# Get FIL

## Exchanges

A cryptocurrency exchange is a digital platform where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies or traditional fiat currencies like USD, EUR, or JPY.

Cryptocurrency exchanges provide a marketplace for users to trade their digital assets and are typically run by private companies that facilitate these transactions. These exchanges can differ in terms of fees, security protocols, and the variety of cryptocurrencies they support.

Users can typically sign up for an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, deposit funds into their account, and then use those funds to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies at the current market price. Some exchanges offer advanced trading features like margin trading, stop-loss orders, and trading bots.

It's important to note that while cryptocurrency exchanges can offer convenience and liquidity for traders, they also come with risks like hacking and regulatory uncertainty. Therefore, users should take precautions to protect their funds and do their own research before using any particular exchange.

### Supported exchanges

There are many exchanges that allow users to buy, sell, and trade FIL. Websites like [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/) and [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/markets/) keep track of which exchanges support which cryptocurrencies. You can use these lists to help you decide which exchange to use.

Once you have found an exchange you want to use, you will have to create an account with that exchange. Many exchanges have strict verification and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes in place, so it may take a few days to create your account. However, most large exchanges can verify your information in a few minutes.

Purchasing cryptocurrency varies from exchange to exchange, but the process is usually something like this:

1. Add funds to your exchange account in your local currency (USD, EUR, YEN, etc.).
2. Exchange your local currency for FIL at a set price.

### Address compatibility

Some exchanges allow users to fund and withdraw FIL using any of the [Filecoin address type](../../smart-contracts/filecoin-evm-runtime/address-types.md). However, some exchanges only support one or a handful of the available address types. Most exchanges do not currently support [f410 addresses](../the-blockchain/addresses.md).

If your exchange does not yet support Filecoin Eth-style 0x addresses, you must create a wallet to _relay_ the funds through. Take a look at the [Transfer FIL page](transfer-fil.md) for details on how to transfer your funds safely.

## Fiat on-ramps

A fiat on-ramp is a service or platform that allows individuals to convert traditional fiat currencies such as the US dollar, Euro, or any other government-issued currency into cryptocurrencies. These on-ramps serve as entry points for people who want to start participating in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by purchasing digital currencies with their money but don't want to sign up with a cryptocurrency exchange.

FIL is supported by a number of fiat on-ramps, such as:

* [Changelly](https://changelly.com/)
* [ChangeNow](https://changenow.io/)
* [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/)
* [Ramp Network](https://ramp.network/)
* [Simplex](https://www.simplex.com/).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you know of any other services that can be added to list this, [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs/issues/new).
{% endhint %}

Users are cautioned to do their own due diligence with respect to choosing a fiat on-ramp provider.

### Crypto ATMs

Crypto ATMs, also known as Bitcoin ATMs, are kiosks that allow individuals to buy and/or sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for fiat currency like the US dollar. They function similarly to traditional ATMs but are not connected to a bank account. Instead, they connect the user directly to a cryptocurrency exchange.

Using a Bitcoin ATM often comes with higher fees than online exchanges. Fees can vary, but they can range anywhere from 5% to 15% or even more per transaction.

## Test FIL

If you’re looking to get FIL to test your applications on a testnet like [Calibration](../../networks/calibration/), then check how to get test tokens! Test FIL is often referred to as `tFIL`.
