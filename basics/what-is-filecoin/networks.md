  The Filecoin network has several networks for testing, staging, and production purposes. This page provides information on available networks.

# Networks

## Mainnet

[Mainnet](../../networks/mainnet/) is the live production network that connects all nodes on the Filecoin network. It operates continuously without resets.

## Testnets

Test networks, or testnets, are versions of the Filecoin network that simulate various aspects of the mainnet. They are intended for testing and should not be used for production applications or services.

### Calibration

The [Calibration](../../networks/calibration/) testnet offers the closest simulation of the mainnet. It provides realistic sealing performance and hardware requirements due to the use of finalized proofs and parameters, allowing prospective storage providers to test their setups. Storage clients can also store and retrieve real data on this network, participating in deal-making workflows and testing storage/retrieval functionalities. Calibration testnet uses the same sector size as the mainnet.
