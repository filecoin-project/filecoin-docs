# Developing contracts

This section covers how to build dApps by writing smart contracts in the Filecoin Virtual Machine.  The docs in this section explain: 
- How to [get test tokens](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/get-test-tokens), called tFIL, from a faucet.
- How to set up [Remix](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/remix), to make use of Ethereum tooling while building Filecoin dApps.
- How to set up [Hardhat](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/hardhat), to build FVM dApps in an environment familiar to Ethereum developers.
- How to make use of [Foundry](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/foundry), expanding the utilities available for interacting with FVM contracts.
- Where to [find contract templates](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/solidity-libraries) from a range of third party Solidity libraries.  
- How to [Call built-in actors](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/call-built-in-actors) using the Protocol API or the Solidity Library.
- How to make use of the Filecoin [Solidity Libraries](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/filecoin.sol) to build FVM dApps using a language familiar to Ethereum developers.
- How to perform a storage deal using the [direct dealmaking client contract](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/client-contract-tutorial).
- How to [replicate, renew, or repair (RaaS)](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/using-raas) storage deals on Filecoin.
- How to [verify a contract](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/verify-a-contract) using one of Filecoin's many block explorers.
- The [best practices](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/best-practices) for building FVM dApps.
