## Storage Onramps

Web-based applications that store your data on Filecoin. No command-line or coding experience required.

* [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.storage/) "offers permanent, decentralized storage powered by Filecoin. Secure, scalable, and ideal for individuals, developers, and enterprises."
* [Storacha](https://storacha.network/) is an open hot storage network scales IPFS and Filecoin. Upload any data and Storacha will ensure it ends up on a decentralized set of IPFS and Filecoin storage providers. There Storacha [docs](https://docs.storacha.network/) detail the JavaScript and Go API libraries, and there is a no-code web uploader available as well.
* [Singularity](https://singularity.storage/) "facilitates onboarding of large quantaties of data (PB-scale) to the Filecoin network in an efficient, secure, and flexible way."
* [CID Gravity](https://www.cidgravity.com/) is a "seamless gateway to the decentralized web", allowing you to drag and drop files through an easy-to-use UI that uploads files to Filecoin and IPFS.  
* [Ramo](https://www.ramo.io/) is "a network coordinating people, hardware and capital to build a more open and resilient internet infrastructure for everyone."  
* [Starling Framework for Data Integrity](https://www.starlinglab.org/)
  * to securely capture, store and verify human history
  * learn more at [`starlinglab.org/78days`](https://www.starlinglab.org/78days/) or the [Filecoin blog interview](https://filecoin.io/blog/starling-framework/)
  * [`Starlingstorage.io`](https://starlingstorage.io/) - API + CLI that simplified storing data to a local Lotus node for preservation use cases.

## APIs & Developer tools

Developer tools, API clients & storage services that developers can use to build on Filecoin.

### Storage APIs for app builders

* [Lighthouse](https://www.lighthouse.storage/) - Lighthouse offers a suite of tools to enable builders to store data on Filecoin when building apps.
* [Fleek’s tools](https://fleek.xyz/) - provides access to Fleek’s hosted services using IPFS, Filecoin, Ethereum, etc.
* [Akave](https://www.akave.ai/) is "revolutionizing data management with a decentralized, modular solution that combines the robust storage of Filecoin with cutting-edge encryption and easy-to-use interfaces."  


### Message signing tools

* [Filecoin Signing Tools](../built-in-actors/) - _**Recommended**_ a pure JS or Rust / WASM / JSONRPC library for creating signed messages apart from a Filecoin node.
  * For an open source example of how to use it see the [Glif web wallet](https://github.com/glifio/wallet) on GitHub.
* [Filecoin JS Signer](https://github.com/blitslabs/filecoin-js-signer) - \[_last update: June 2021_] pure TS / JS library for creating signed messages and interacting with Filecoin’s built-in Actors (like Payment Channel and Multisig), used by the [Filecoin Loans grant project](https://github.com/blitslabs/filecoin.loans-monorepo).
  * On npm at [`@blitslabs/filecoin-js-signer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blitslabs/filecoin-js-signer)

### Wallet-related tools

* [FilSnap MetaMask Plugin](https://metamask.io/flask/) - MetaMask has a new plugin system currently still in beta that developers can try out. The MM UI will not change but Filecoin keys are in the MM vault.

### Node Infrastructure & APIs

> NOTE: making deep calls into the chain’s history may take some time to return and it may be more efficient to use a chain database (e.g. used by block explorers) that stores the chain’s history and is optimized for queries.

* [GLIF nodes](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/developers/glif-nodes/) - A hosted endpoint to Filecoin mainnet and testnet. Note: as of Q1 2023, Infura no longer supports Filecoin.
  * The GLIF endpoint supports read-only calls and `MPoolPush()` for sending signed transactions to the network (which can be signed using the [Message signing tools](https://docs.filecoin.io/reference/general/overview/#message-signing-tools)).
* [**Lotus JSON-RPC API**](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/get-started/what-is-lotus/) - Lotus offers the full feature set of its capabilities through API.
  * [lotus API Postman sample](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4872192/SWLh5mUd?version=latest) - (shows sample wallet calls only)

**Scalable endpoint hosting**

For running a node cluster of load balanced Lotus JSON RPC API endpoints.

* [Filecoin-chart](https://github.com/glifio/filecoin-chart) (k8 cluster) - Helm chart for hosting Lotus Node clients.

**Filecoin API clients**

* [`Filecoin.js`](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/filecoin.js) (outdated) - higher-level JS library for interacting with Lotus via JSON-RPC API.
* [`js-lotus-client`](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client) - lower-level JS wrapper for basic parsing of the Lotus JSON RPC API.
* [`lotus-json-rpc-provider`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coinsummer/lotus-jsonrpc-provider) (outdated) - wraps the Lotus API in TypeScript.

**Storage provider index API**

* [Filrep.io API](https://filrep.io/api) - A suite of RESTFul JSON endpoints to discover the best storage provider to make deals with.

### Data prep tools

* [CAR files](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/) - automatically used on Lotus import for less than 32 and 64 GiB, Filecoin archive format serialized from DAGs, see also [building with the Lotus API](https://lotus.filecoin.io/tutorials/lotus/build-with-lotus-api/).
* [`go-graphsplit`](https://github.com/filedrive-team/go-graphsplit) - FileDrive chunks a larger single DAG for storage in default Filecoin 32 and 64 GiB sector sizes.
* [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech) - you can use `ipfs add` with an IPFS node then [add the CID from a Filecoin node](https://docs.filecoin.io/builder-cookbook/data-storage/store-data).

### Databases using IPFS and Filecoin

* [Tableland](https://tableland.xyz/) - (new) create familiar SQL tables to read and write dynamic NFT metadata or application data for dApps, from Textile.
* [OrbitDB](https://orbitdb.org/) - decentralized multi-party database on IPFS with multi-party syncing with topic pubsub and CRDTs.
* [ThreadsDB](https://docs.textile.io/threads/) - decentralized multi-party database for user-siloed data on IPFS, from Textile.

### Other developer tools
