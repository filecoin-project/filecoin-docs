{{ $tooltips := dict
    "block reward" "FIL awarded based on the amount of storage power a storage provider is able to provide, weighted by quality multipliers of the different deal types stored."    "consensus" " Any procedure used to achieve agreement, trust, and security in a decentralized network."
    "blocktime" "The average time it takes for a new tipset (sometimes called a block) to be added to the Filecoin network. The Filecoin blocktime is 30 seconds."
    "Byzantine fault-tolerant" "The ability of a blockchain to continue to operate correctly even if some nodes fail, stop performing their functions, or act maliciously."
    "CID" "Short for 'Content Identifier'. A unique identifier that represents the content of a file or any other piece of data in the IPFS network."
    "CIDs" "Short for 'Content Identifier'. A unique identifier that represents the content of a file or any other piece of data in the IPFS network."
    "commP" "The commitment phase of the Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) process."
    "cryptographic proving systems" "A cryptographic protocol where a prover proves something to a verifier. Used by all blockchains."
    "consensus" "Any method used to achieve agreement, trust, and security in a blockchain. "
    "deferred execution" "A mechanism in which the execution of every message is deferred by one epoch."
    "drand" "A publicly verifiable, unbiasable random beacon protocol used to generate a series of deterministic, verifiable random values."
    "DataCap" "A resource that can be added storage deals, increasing that deal's value for storage providers by a factor of 10."
    "dApps" "Decentralized applications that don't rely on centralized infrastructure."
    "epoch" "The fundamental unit of time in the Filecoin blockchain, currently 30 seconds in length."
    "EVM" "The Ethereum Virtual Machine: a runtime environment that executes smart contracts developed for the Ethereum blockchain."
    "Filecoin EVM runtime" "The Ethereum virtual machine execution environment in which Solidity smart contracts are executed on the Filecoin blockchain."
    "f410 addresses" "An Ethereum-style 0x address on the Filecoin network."
    "full node" "A computer that stores a complete copy of the Filecoin blockchain."
    "IPFS" "The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer protocol for sharing and storing files on the internet, designed to be decentralized and distributed."
    "Lotus" "The reference node implementation for the Filecoin network."
    "Lily" "Software designed to simplify the recording of blockchain data."
    "Nonce" "An identifying number for every message or transaction; derived from the phrase 'number only used once'."
    "partition" "A group of 2349 sectors."
    "PoRep" "Proof of Replication (PoRep) is a mechanism used to verify that a storage provider is storing data on behalf of a client by requiring the provider to prove that they have replicated the client's data to their storage space."
    "power" "A measurement of the amount of storage provided over time by a storage provider."
    "proving period" "24 hours, broken down into 30 minute, non-overlapping deadlines, for a total of 48 deadlines."
    "QAP" "Quality Adjusted Power (QAP) is a metric used to measure a miner's contribution to the network's storage capacity. QAP takes into account not only the amount of storage capacity a miner has committed to the network but also the quality of that storage capacity, as well as how long the data has been stored."
    "sector" "The basic units of storage on Filecoin. Sectors have standard sizes, as well as well-defined time-increments for commitments, and can contain pieces from multiple deals and clients."
    "sectors" "The basic units of storage on Filecoin. Sectors have standard sizes, as well as well-defined time-increments for commitments, and can contain pieces from multiple deals and clients."
    "tFIL" "Test FIL used on Filecoin testnets. tFIL has no real-world value."
    "web3" "A new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics."
    "WindowPoSt" "Window Proof-of-Spacetime, or WindowPoSt, is a cryptographic proof that demonstrates to the network that a miner is still storing the promised data over a particular period of time."
    "WinningPoSt" "(Winning Proof-of-Spacetime, or WinningPoSt, is a cryptographic proof that demonstrates to the network that a miner has stored and is still storing the correct data as agreed upon with the network, over a long period of time."
