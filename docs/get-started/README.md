# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The Filecoin Network is made by miners and clients. They [make deals](../about-filecoin/how-filecoin-works.md) and contribute to maintaining the Filecoin blockchain, obtaining storage services and receiving rewards in the process.

[[TOC]]

## Ready, set, go!

### 1. Become familiar with the concepts

- Read [How Filecoin Works](../about-filecoin/how-filecoin-works.md) and [IPFS and Filecoin](../about-filecoin/ipfs-and-filecoin.md).
- Complete the [Protoschool tutorial](https://proto.school/verifying-storage-on-filecoin/) to get a closer, practical look.
- Check out the [existing networks](https://networks.filecoin.io).
- Explore the mainnet using one of the [available block explorers](explore-the-network.md). Discover the blocks, the messages, the scoreboards for miners. Watch the self-adjusting base fee, the deals and all the things tracked by the chain.

### 2. Store content on Filecoin

- Visit [Slate](../store/slate.md) to store content on Filecoin and make deals from your browser.
- Install and launch your [Lotus Node](lotus/README.md). Setup your first wallet and learn how to [send and receive ⨎](lotus/send-and-receive-fil.md) and [make storage deals](../store/lotus/store-data.md).
- Use [Starling](../store/starling.md) to simplify the management of storage deals in Lotus.

### 3. Contribute to Filecoin

- [Mine Filecoin](../mine/README.md): for those wanting to provide storage and retrieval capabilities to the Network.
- [Build on Filecoin](../build/README.md): for those wanting to build applications that interact with the Filecoin network.

### Filecoin implementations

There are 4 Filecoin protocol implementations (or “node software”) currently in progress:

- [lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/) (Go): This implementation is closest to feature-complete and is therefore, the recommended Filecoin protocol implementation.
- [forest](https://github.com/chainsafe/forest) (Rust)
- [fuhon](https://github.com/filecoin-project/cpp-filecoin) (C++)
- [go-filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin) (Go)

Each of these software clients implements the Filecoin protocol as described in the [Filecoin protocol specification](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs). To learn more about why there are multiple Filecoin implementations, please read [this blog post](https://filecoin.io/blog/announcing-filecoin-implementations-in-rust-and-c++/).

Here is a snapshot of each implementation’s progress across the primary parts of the Filecoin protocol (updated June 24, 2020):
