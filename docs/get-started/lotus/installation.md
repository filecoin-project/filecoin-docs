{{ $frontmatter.description }}. This guide covers installing `lotus`, `lotus-miner` and `lotus-worker` to your computer, and then runs through setting up a Lotus node. For information on running the miner, check the [Lotus Miner documentation](../../mine/lotus/README.md).

[[TOC]]

## Minimal requirements

To run a Lotus node, your computer must have:

- macOS or Linux installed. Windows is not yet supported.
- a quad-core CPU. Models with support for _Intel SHA Extensions_ (AMD since Zen microarchitecture, or Intel since Ice Lake) will significantly speed things up.
- 8 GiB RAM
- Enough space to store the current Lotus chain (preferably on an SSD storage medium). The chain grows at approximately 12 GiB per week.

:::warning
These are the minimal requirements to run a Lotus node. [Hardware requirements for Miners](../../mine/hardware-requirements.md) are different.
:::

## Linux

The following instructions are specific to Linux installations. Head to the [macOS](#macos) section if you want to install Lotus on a Mac.

### Software dependencies

You will need the following software installed to install and run Lotus.

#### System-specific

Building Lotus requires some system dependencies, usually provided by your distribution.

| Linux distribution | Dependency install command                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Arch Linux         | `sudo pacman -Syu opencl-icd-loader gcc git bzr jq pkg-config opencl-icd-loader opencl-headers`                                                                                               |
| Ubuntu/Debian      | `sudo apt install mesa-opencl-icd ocl-icd-opencl-dev gcc git bzr jq pkg-config curl clang build-essential -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`                                                                |
| Fedora             | `sudo dnf -y install gcc make git bzr jq pkgconfig mesa-libOpenCL mesa-libOpenCL-devel opencl-headers ocl-icd ocl-icd-devel clang llvm wget`                                                  |
| OpenSUSE           | `sudo zypper in gcc git jq make libOpenCL1 opencl-headers ocl-icd-devel clang llvm && sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libOpenCL.so.1 /usr/lib64/libOpenCL.so`                                           |
| Amazon Linux 2     | `sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epest-7.noarch.rpm; sudo yum install -y git gcc bzr jq pkgconfig clang llvm mesa-libGL-devel opencl-headers ocl-icd ocl-icd-devel` |

#### Rustup

Lotus needs [rustup](https://rustup.rs). The easiest way to install it is:

```sh	
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh	
```

:::tip	
Make sure your `$PATH` variable is correctly configured after the rustup installation so that `cargo` and `rustc` are found in their rustup-configured locations.	
:::

#### Go

To build Lotus, you need a working installation of [Go 1.14 or higher](https://golang.org/dl/):

```bash
wget -c https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local
```

Make sure that `/usr/local/go/bin` is in your `PATH`. If you are running into problems, check the [official Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for your operating system.

### Build and install Lotus

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can build and install the Lotus suite (`lotus`, `lotus-miner`, and `lotus-worker`).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus.git
   cd lotus/
   ```

1. Checkout the branch corresponding to the network you want to join. If you are changing networks from a previous Lotus installation or there has been a network reset, read the [Switch networks guide](./switch-networks.md) before proceeding. You can look up the correct branch or tag for the network you want to join in the [networks dashboard](https://networks.filecoin.io):

   ```sh
   git checkout <branch_or_tag>
   ```

   Currently, the _master_ branch corresponds to **testnet**.

1. If you are in China, check out the specific [tips](tips-running-in-china.md).
1. Depending on your CPU model, you will need to export additional environment variables:

   If you have **an AMD Zen or Intel Ice Lake CPU (or later)**, enable the use of SHA extensions by adding these two environment variables:

   ```sh
   export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -g"
   export FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1
   ```

   See the [Native Filecoin FFI section](#native-filecoin-ffi) for more details about this process.

   If you are building Lotus 0.7.1 and have an Intel or AMD processor without the AXD instruction set, add the `CGO_CFLAGS` environment variable:

   ```sh
   export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
   export CGO_CFLAGS="-D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
   ```

   This is due to a Lotus bug that prevents Lotus from running on processor without `axd` instruction support, and should be fixed soon.

1. Build and install Lotus:

   ```sh
   make clean all
   sudo make install
   ```

   This will put `lotus`, `lotus-miner` and `lotus-worker` in `/usr/local/bin`.

   `lotus` will use the `$HOME/.lotus` folder by default for storage (configuration, chain data, wallets, etc). See [advanced options](configuration-and-advanced-usage.md) for information on how to customize the Lotus folder.

1. You should now have Lotus installed. You can now [start the Lotus daemon](#start-the-lotus-daemon).

#### Native Filecoin FFI

Some newer CPU architectures like AMD's Zen and Intel's Ice Lake, have support for SHA extensions. Having these extensions enabled significantly speeds up your Lotus node. To make full use of your processor's capabilities, make sure you set the following variables **before building from source**:

```sh
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -g"
export FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1
```

This method of building does not produce portable binaries. Make sure you run the binary on the same computer as you built it.

### Systemd service files

Lotus provides **generic** Systemd service files. They can be installed with:

```sh
make install-daemon-service
make install-miner-service
```

::: warning
Provided service files should be **inspected and edited** according to user needs as they are very generic and may lack specific environment variabes and settings needed by the users.

One example is that logs are redirected to files in `/var/log/lotus` by default and not visible in `journalctl`.
:::

## macOS

These instructions are specific to macOS. If you are installing Lotus on a Linux distribution, head over to the [Linux section](#linux).

### XCode Command Line Tools

Lotus requires that X-Code CLI tools be installed before building the Lotus binaries.

1. Check if you already have the XCode Command Line Tools installed via the CLI, run:

   ```sh
   xcode-select -p
   ```

   If this command returns a path, you can move on to the [next step](#install-homebrew). Otherwise, to install via the CLI, run:

   ```sh
   xcode-select --install
   ```

1. To update, run:

   ```sh
   sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
   xcode-select --install
   ```

### Install Homebrew

We recommend that MacOS users use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install each of the necessary packages.

1. Use the command `brew install` to install the following packages:

   ```sh
   brew install go bzr jq pkg-config rustup
   ```

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus.git
   cd lotus/
   ```

1. Checkout the branch corresponding to the network you want to join. If you are changing networks from a previous Lotus installation or there has been a network reset, read the [Switch networks guide](./switch-networks.md) before proceeding. You can look up the correct branch or tag for the network you want to join in the [networks dashboard](https://networks.filecoin.io):

   ```sh
   git checkout <branch_or_tag>
   ```

   Currently, the _master_ branch corresponds to **testnet**.

1. If you are in China, check out the specific [tips](tips-running-in-china.md).
1. Build Lotus:

   ```sh
   make clean && make all
   sudo make install
   ```

1. You should now have Lotus installed. You can now [start the Lotus daemon](#start-the-lotus-daemon).

## Start the Lotus daemon

The `lotus` application runs as a daemon and a client to control and interact with that daemon. A daemon is a long-running program that is usually run in the background.

To start the Lotus daemon run:

```sh
lotus daemon
## When running with systemd do:
# systemctl start lotus-daemon
```

During the first run, Lotus will:

- Setup its data folder at `~/.lotus`.
- Download the necessary proof parameters. This is a few gigabytes of data that is downloaded once.
- Start syncing the Lotus chain.

The daemon will start producing lots of log messages right away.

:::tip
Do not be concerned by the number of warnings and sometimes errors showing in the logs. They are usually part of the usual functioning of the daemon as part of a distributed network.
:::

## Chain sync

As in many other blockchains, the Lotus Node will need to sync to the _tip_ of the chain after learning about this. We call this process _chain sync_. First, the headers for every block will be synced from tip to bottom. Afterward, blocks will be fetched and verified from bottom to top. To inspect the current sync status run:

```sh
lotus sync status
```

You can also interactively wait for the chain to be fully synced:

```
lotus sync wait
```

:::tip
Syncing the Filecoin chain can be a very slow process, and the state size is quite large. Unless you need the full historical chain state, we suggest importing a pruned chain snapshot when the Lotus daemon starts:

```sh
# The snapshot size is about 4GiB
lotus daemon --import-snapshot https://very-temporary-spacerace-chain-snapshot.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Spacerace_pruned_stateroots_snapshot_latest.car
```

Alternatively, you can also import a non-pruned snapshot:

```sh
# Snapshot size ~40GiB
lotus daemon --import-snapshot https://very-temporary-spacerace-chain-snapshot.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Spacerace_stateroots_snapshot_latest.car
```

For more information about creating chain snapshots, [see the Chain snapshots section](./chain-snapshots.md).
:::

To check how far behind you are when syncing the chain, run the following command:

```sh
date -d @$(./lotus chain getblock $(./lotus chain head) | jq .Timestamp)
```

## Interact with the daemon

The `lotus` command allows you to interact with a _running_ Lotus daemon. The `lotus-miner` and `lotus-worker` commands work in the same way.

Lotus comes with built-in CLI documentation:

```sh
# Show general help
lotus --help
# Show specific help for the "client" subcommand
lotus client --help
```

For example, after your Lotus daemon has been running for a few minutes, use `lotus` to check the number of other peers that it is connected to in the Filecoin network:

```sh
lotus net peers
```


## Stop the Lotus daemon

In order to gracefully stop the running lotus daemon (required when restarting the daemon to update Lotus), use the following command:

```sh
lotus daemon stop
## When running with systemd do:
# systemctl stop lotus-daemon
```
