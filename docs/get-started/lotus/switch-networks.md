title: 'Lotus: switch networks'
description: There may be times, particularly when testing, where you wish to switch to a different Filecoin network or need to reconnect to a testing network after a network reset. This guide will show you how to switch between different Filecoin networks with Lotus.

As we mentioned in the [installation guide](installation.md), Lotus is compiled to operate on a single network, and the information in the configuration folder corresponds to that network.

There are multiple methods to make Lotus run on a different network:

[[TOC]]

## Approach 1: Clean, re-build, and re-install

The first method is the simplest. In this approach, you remove all the data related to the network you were running on before and launch a Lotus binary built to run on the new one:

1. Shutdown the running Lotus daemon.
2. Remove the `~/.lotus` (or `$LOTUS_PATH`) folder.
3. Rebuild and install Lotus on the right branch or release, as defined in the [Networks dashboard](https://networks.filecoin.io).
4. Start the Lotus daemon again and let it sync to the new network.

This process deletes everything from the old network, including wallets. Make sure you have functioning backups of important data before attempting to switch networks.

## Approach 2: Install and run on a different \$LOTUS_PATH

This method allows you to keep all the data from the old network where it was, and instead set `$LOTUS_PATH` to a new, clean location so that Lotus will use it. This method is useful if you need to run Lotus using the original network shortly after switching networks.

1. Shutdown the running Lotus daemon.
2. Rebuild and install Lotus on the right branch or release (as defined in the [Networks dashboard](https://networks.filecoin.io).
3. Set `LOTUS_PATH` to a new location. i.e. `export LOTUS_PATH=~/.lotus2`.
4. Start the Lotus daemon again and let it sync to the new network.

## Backing up Lotus data

If you wish to backup Lotus data, simply copy the `~/.lotus` (or `$LOTUS_PATH`) folder somewhere. This copy might take time if it is very large, especially if you've synced the full network.

Another alternative is to [export your wallets](send-and-receive-fil.md) and also [export the chain](chain-snapshots.md) for later re-import on a newly installed Lotus Node.
