In order to receive and send FIL with Lotus you will need to have [installed and be running a Lotus Node](installation.md).

[[TOC]]

## Creating a wallet

```bash
lotus wallet new bls
```

This will print your Filecoin address.

::: tip
Your wallet information is stored in the `~/.lotus/keystore` (or `$LOTUS_PATH/keystore`). For instructions on export/import, see below.
:::

You can create multiple wallets and list them with:

```bash
lotus wallet list
```

## Obtaining FIL

FIL can be obtained either by using one of the Faucets (check URLs in the [Networks dashboard](https://networks.filecoin.io) or by buying it from an exchange supporting FIL trading (once mainnet has launched).

Once you have received some FIL you can check your balance with:

```bash
lotus wallet balance
```

Remember that your will only see the latest balance when your daemon is fully synced to the current tip of the chain.

## Sending FIL

Sending some FIL can be achieved by running:

```bash
lotus wallet send <address> <amount>
```

:::tip
Make sure to check `lotus wallet send --help` for advanced options.
:::

## Exporting and importing a wallet

::: warning
Keep your wallets' private keys safe!
:::

You can export and re-import a wallet with:

```bash
lotus wallet export <address> > wallet.private
```

and:

```bash
lotus wallet import wallet.private
```
