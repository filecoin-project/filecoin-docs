# Lotus

{{ $frontmatter.description }}

It is written in [Go](https://golang.org) and it is actually a suite of command-line applications:

- Lotus Node (`lotus`): a Filecoin Node: validates network transactions, manages a FIL wallet, can perform storage and retrieval deals.
- Lotus Miner (`lotus-miner`): a Filecoin miner. See the the respective [Lotus Miner](../../mine/lotus/) section in the [Mine](../../mine/) documentation.
- Lotus Worker (`lotus-worker`): a worker that assists miners to perform mining-related tasks. See its respective [guide](../../mine/lotus/seal-workers) for more information.

The installation instructions are common to all three, but this section just focuses on getting started with the **Lotus Node**: installing, launching, syncing the chain and managing a Lotus wallet. Documentation on how to make storage deals using Lotus is available in the [store](../../store/lotus/README.md) section. Additional documentation is also available for [miners](../../mine/lotus/) and [developers](../../build/lotus/)!

::: warning
Lotus is a command line application that **works on Linux and MacOS only**, and needs to be **built from source**. Users should be familiar with how command-line applications work.
