This guide will help you get started with Hosted Powergate. For more information about Powergate as a software solution for Filecoin storage see the [Powergate page](powergate.md) in the store section.

Hosted Powergate provides access to a Powergate's **Filecoin File System API (FFS API) instance**. We will be using the Powergate CLI to interact with the FFS API endpoint provided to us, but additional bindings are available for [Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/textileio/powergate/api/client) and [JS](https://textileio.github.io/js-powergate-client/).
