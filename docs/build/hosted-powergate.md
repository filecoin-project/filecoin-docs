[Powergate](powergate.md) is a multitiered storage solution that stores data with IPFS ("Hot" storage layer) and Filecoin ("Cold" storage layer). Hosted Powergate instances are available for builders upon request.

This guide will help you get started with _Hosted Powergate_. Access to hosted Powergate instances is provided via the **Filecoin File System API (FFS API)**. We will be using the Powergate CLI to interact with the FFS API endpoint provided to us and getting familiar with it, but additional bindings are available for [Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/textileio/powergate/api/client) and [JS](https://textileio.github.io/js-powergate-client/).
