# Step 2 - Run the React app

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Xcode CommandLineTools](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014588-CH1-WHAT_IS_THE_COMMAND_LINE_TOOLS_PACKAGE_)

## Steps

1. In a third terminal window, clone the React sample application and check out the `local` branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/filecoin-network-inspector
cd filecoin-network-inspector
git checkout local
```

2. Start the app.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This starts the Filecoin network inspector app and opens the application in your browser at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

::: tip
We have used [React](https://reactjs.org/) as our UI library an [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for application state management. You can use any other library or framework to build such an app.

Next, we walk through the different parts of the application to see how to integrate Filecoin features and functionality into your application.
