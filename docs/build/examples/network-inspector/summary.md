# Summary

This tutorial walked you through building a React application that interacts with an IPFS node and a lotus node to store data on the Filecoin network and inspect information about the Filecoin blockchain.

The main topics covered:

- What is Lotus and how it interacts with an IPFS node.
- Setting up your own local Filecoin devnet.
- Using different JavaScript libraries to connect with any running Filecoin network.
- Using the JavaScript libraries to query the lotus node endpoints for wallet data.
- Using the JavaScript libraries to query the lotus node endpoints for chain data.
- Using the JavaScript libraries to query the lotus node endpoints for miner data.
- Using the JavaScript libraries to create storage deals.
- Using the JavaScript libraries to monitor storage deal status.
- Using the JavaScript libraries to create retrieval deals.
- Retrieving data from an IPFS node.
- Retrieving data from a lotus node.
