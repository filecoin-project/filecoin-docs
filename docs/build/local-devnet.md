## Textile's `lotus-devnet`

Textile developers have created a quick way to run a Lotus Devnet (with or without Docker) for testing purposes. Apart from being very easy to setup, its main advantange is the use of a mocked _sectorbuilder_ so that expensive operations like sealing feel like a breeze.

You can read documentation, instructions and support options in the source repository: [https://github.com/textileio/lotus-devnet](https://github.com/textileio/lotus-devnet).

## Devnet with vanilla Lotus binaries

This approach uses stock Lotus binaries (see the [installation instructions](../get-started/lotus/installation.md) for reference) and will launch Lotus using small 2KiB sectors, which allow regular workstations to perform mining operations.

If you are building Lotus >= 0.7.1 and have an **older Intel or AMD processor** (MacOS), set the following ENV variables before running `make 2k`:

```
export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW="-D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
export CGO_CFLAGS="-D__BLST_PORTABLE__"
```

To get started, build the Lotus binaries in debug mode, enabling the use of 2048 byte sectors:

```sh
# After cloning the Lotus repository
make 2k
```

Set the `LOTUS_SKIP_GENESIS_CHECK` environment variable to `_yes_`. This tells your Lotus node that it's okay if the genesis being used doesn't match any baked-in genesis.

```sh
export LOTUS_SKIP_GENESIS_CHECK=_yes_
```

Download the 2048 byte parameters:

```sh
./lotus fetch-params 2048
```

Pre-seal some sectors:

```sh
./lotus-seed pre-seal --sector-size 2KiB --num-sectors 2
```

Create the genesis block and start up the first node:

```sh
./lotus-seed genesis new localnet.json
./lotus-seed genesis add-miner localnet.json ~/.genesis-sectors/pre-seal-t01000.json
./lotus daemon --lotus-make-genesis=devgen.car --genesis-template=localnet.json --bootstrap=false
```

Then, in another console, import the genesis miner key:

```sh
./lotus wallet import --as-default ~/.genesis-sectors/pre-seal-t01000.key
```

Set up the genesis miner:

```sh
./lotus-miner init --genesis-miner --actor=t01000 --sector-size=2KiB --pre-sealed-sectors=~/.genesis-sectors --pre-sealed-metadata=~/.genesis-sectors/pre-seal-t01000.json --nosync
```

Now, finally, start up the miner:

```sh
./lotus-miner run --nosync
```

If all went well, you will have your own local Lotus Devnet running.
