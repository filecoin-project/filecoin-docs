# Build

Filecoin is for the builders. If you are excited about the potential of leveraging the Filecoin protocol and decentralized storage network to build game-changing applications, you've come to the right place.

This section groups documentation to help developers integrate with applications that interact with the Filecoin network and with Filecoin implementations. Among other things, in it you will learn:

- How to setup Lotus [Lotus](lotus/README.md) APIs, generate tokens and perform requests.
- Learn about [Powergate](powergate.md) and other projects providing APIs that simplify interacting with Filecoin.
- How to run a [Filecoin local devnet](local-devnet.md) on your own computer using Docker.
- Learn from [example applications](examples/README.md) that teach how you step by step how to build a Filecoin powered application.

::: tip
For most developers, the easiest path is to rely on a [Filecoin-backed pinning services (FPS)](filecoin-pinning-services.md), as they do not require running any infrastructure.

Additionally, Protocol Labs offers [hosted Lotus nodes](lotus/hosted-nodes.md).
