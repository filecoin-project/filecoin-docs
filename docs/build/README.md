# Build

Filecoin is for the builders. If you are excited about the potential of leveraging the Filecoin protocol and decentralized storage network to build game-changing applications, you've come to the right place.

:::tip
Use one of the community built tools and services to get started. [Take a look now →](../store/README.md)
:::

## Get started

There are several options to start integrating with Filecoin. Here are some guides to get you started:

- [Build with Glif-nodes](hosted-lotus.md), for users looking for an endpoint to submit messages to the chain. Standalone Lotus, with optional Powergate, are also available).
- [Build with Lotus](lotus/README.md), for users looking to interact with their own, local Lotus nodes.
- [Build with Powergate](powergate.md), for users wanting to combine IPFS (fast retrieval) and Filecoin (backup) with full control of both.
- [Build with Textile buckets](textile-buckets.md), for users looking for simple IPFS storage with Filecoin-based archival, with encryption and shared buckets support.
- [Store and retrieve data](../get-started/store-and-retrieve) directly with a Lotus node by following this tutorial series.

## Filecoin-backed storage providers

The following products provide storage solutions that are backed up by the Filecoin network and potentially [integrate IPFS as a hot-data layer (FPS)](filecoin-pinning-services.md).

::: tip
We plan to update this list regularly as new providers are announced and their features expand.

## Hosted nodes

Hosted node providers take care of running Filecoin node software for you so that you can focus on integrating and building on top of it.
