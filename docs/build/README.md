# Build

Filecoin is for the builders. If you are excited about the potential of leveraging the Filecoin protocol and decentralized storage network to build game-changing applications, you’ve come to the right place. In this section, you will find some helpful resources as you get started building applications on Filecoin.

Read the resources in the **Start Building** section before you begin for helpful pointers on application architecture and networks to use when interacting and testing with Filecoin.

- [Interacting with the network](./start-building/interacting-with-the-network.md)

**Core Products** gives you an overview of the three main categories of products that we recommend to developers, and high-level pointers on how to run and integrate them in your application.

- **For most developers**, we recommend getting started with [Filecoin-backed IPFS Pinning Services](./tools/filecoin-backed-pinning.md). This is especially true if you’re coming to Filecoin from IPFS or other web3 ecosystems.
- **For some developers who want to manage their own nodes**, we recommend using [Powergate](./tools/powergate.md).
- **For very advanced, protocol-level developers**, we recommend using [Filecoin protocol implementations](./start-building/implementations.md), e.g. [lotus](https://lotu.sh).

**Developer Tools** provides brief descriptions and links to tools and libraries that provide important functionality for application developers.

- [Wallets, signing tools, and API clients](./tools/) and [Filecoin Community Resources](https://github.com/filecoin-project/docs/wiki#community-resources) will direct you to various resources you can use in your applications
- The [Slate Component Design System](https://slate.host/_/system) is a design system that includes Filecoin-branded web UI components and tutorials that you can integrate into your application.

**Examples** includes end-to-end code examples, tutorials, and walkthroughs for applications built on Filecoin. The examples section currently features:

- [Meme Marketplace](./examples/meme-marketplace/overview.md): An example application built on Textile Hub, a Filecoin-backed IPFS Pinning Service.
- [Simple Pinning Service](./examples/simple-pinning-service/overview.md): An example application built on Powergate.
- [Slate](./examples/slate/overview.md): A production application built on Powergate.
- [Network Inspector](./examples/network-inspector/overview.md): An example application built on lotus.
