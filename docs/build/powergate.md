{{ $frontmatter.description }}

Powergate exposes higher-level APIs for developers that facilitate easier interaction with IPFS and Filecoin nodes. Powergate also handles wallet management, long-term deal management, and provides many features that improve the overall experience of being a storage client on Filecoin.

You can read more about Powergate in the [Textile docs](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/).

Powergate is the **recommended solution** for developers who want an easier interface and better performance from Filecoin, but who prefer to manage their own nodes.
