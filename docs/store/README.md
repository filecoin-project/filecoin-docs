# Store data on Filecoin

Storing data on Filecoin lets users harness the power of a distributed network and an open market served by thousands of different storage providers, or miners.

## Get started

Users can use the following software solutions to store data on the Filecoin network:

- [Slate](slate.md) allows uploading and storing content on the Filecoin network directly from your browser. It supports one time deals and it is perfect to create image galleries.
- [Lotus](lotus/README.md) import data and perform deals on the chain using its daemon and its CLI. Lotus users get full control of the deals, the chosen miners and the wallets used to pay. Make sure you are familiar with [Lotus](../get-started/lotus/README.md) and have it [installed and running](../get-started/lotus/installation.md).
- [Starling](starling.md) provides simplified decentralized storage for preservation, using Lotus but simplifying the usage.

## Additional resources

There are additional storage solutions that you should not miss. While they have a focus on developers, some of them have simple CLI interfaces that simplify their usage:

- [Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate) a multitiered storage solution that stores data with [IPFS and Filecoin](../about-filecoin/ipfs-and-filecoin.md). It can be used [self-hosted](../build/powergate.md) or [hosted](../build/hosted-powergate.md).
- [Textile buckets](../build/textile-buckets.md) provides S3-like storage using IPFS with Filecoin-backed archival.
- [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) is an IPFS pinning service that will soon include Filecoin in its portfolio.
