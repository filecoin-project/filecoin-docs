# Filecoin 文档

<!-- Need CN translation -->

**Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files on the internet, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time.**

Available storage and pricing is not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in.

The **Filecoin project documentation** homepage offers all the necessary resources to learn about Filecoin, the software and the tools to contribute to the network, either as a user looking for storage, or as a miner providing it. Here are some links to get you started:

<!--
* If you're new to web3 and Filecoin, we recommend checking out [What is Filecoin?](/about-filecoin/what-is-filecoin).
* Users wanting to learn how Filecoin works, how to run a Filecoin node and how to store content in the network, please head to [Get started](/store/) section.
* Miners looking to provide storage to the network should head to the [Mining docs](/mine/)
* Developers interested in building applications that interact with the Filecoin network and nodes can find information in the [Build section](/build/).
* If you're a developer looking to get started building on Filecoin, check out the Build section.
