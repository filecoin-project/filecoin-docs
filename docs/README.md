# Filecoin Documentation

**Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files on the internet, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time.**

Available storage and pricing is not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in.

There are many ways to participate in the Filecoin network, and several libraries, tools, products, and services to choose from:

- If you're new to web3 and Filecoin, we recommend checking out the resources in [this guide](/introduction/new-to-web3.md).
- If you're a developer looking to get started building on Filecoin, check out the [Build section](./build/README.md).
