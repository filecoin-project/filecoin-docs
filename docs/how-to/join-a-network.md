# Joining a network

Once a Lotus node has been initialised on the appropriate [Filecoin network option](https://docs.filecoin.io/how-to/networks/), this section provides setup instructions for syncing the chain, creating a wallet, checking balances and sending FIL to other addresses.

### Note: Using the Lotus Node from China

If you are trying to use `lotus` from China, set this **environment variable** on your machine:

```sh
IPFS_GATEWAY="https://proof-parameters.s3.cn-south-1.jdcloud-oss.com/ipfs/"
```

## Get started

Start the **daemon** using the default configuration in `./build`:

```sh
lotus daemon
```

In another terminal window, check your connection with peers:

```sh
lotus net peers | wc -l
```

 > **NOTICE:** Make sure there is a reasonable "open files limit" set on the machine, such as 10000. If you're seeing a lower value, such as 256 (default on macOS), read our [troubleshooting instructions](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/mining-troubleshooting/) on how to update it prior to starting the Lotus daemon.

## Chain sync

While the daemon is running, the next requirement is to sync the chain. Run the command below to view the chain sync progress. To see current chain height, visit the appropriate network statistics page.

```sh
lotus sync wait
```

- This step will take anywhere between a few hours to a couple of days.
- You will be able to perform Lotus operations after it is finished.

## Create your first address

Initialize a new wallet:

```sh
lotus wallet new
```

Sometimes your operating system may limit file name length to under 150 characters. You need to use a file system that supports long filenames.

Here is an example of the response:

```sh
t1aswwvjsae63tcrniz6x5ykvsuotlgkvlulnqpsi
```

- Use an appropriate faucet to acquire FIL
- Paste the address you created
- Press the send button

## Check wallet address balance

Wallet balances in Lotus are in **FIL**, the smallest denomination of FIL is an **attoFil**, where 1 attoFil = 10^-18 FIL.

```sh
lotus wallet balance <YOUR_NEW_ADDRESS>
```

You will not see any attoFIL in your wallet if your **chain** is not fully synced.

## Send FIL to another wallet

To send FIL to another wallet from your default account, use this command:

```
lotus send <target> <amount>
```

## Configure your node's connectivity

To effectively accept incoming storage & retrieval deals, your Lotus node needs to be accessible to other nodes on the network. To improve your connectivity, be sure to: 

- [Set the multiaddresses for you miner to listen on](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/connectivity/#setting-multiaddresses)
- [Maintain a healthy peer count](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/connectivity/#checking-peer-count)
- [Enable port forwarding](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/connectivity/#port-forwarding)
- [Configure your public IP address and port](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/connectivity/#setting-a-public-ip-address)

## Monitor the dashboard

To see the latest network activity, including **chain block height**, **block height**, **blocktime**, **total network power**, largest **block producer miner**, check out the network's monitoring dashboard.

## Upgrade in place
Here’s how to upgrade in place, with minimum impact:
* `Back up your wallet`: just in case
  ```bash
  lotus wallet export t3… > path/wallet.keyinfo
  ```
* `Find a good upgrade window`: If you are running miner(s), check if your miner is safe to shut down and restart: 
  ```bash
  lotus-miner proving info
  ```
  If any deadline shows a block height in the past, do not restart. See examples below.

    In the following example, `Deadline Sectors` is 0 which means no sectors are currently being challenged in this deadline. This deadline closes at epoch 514, as indicated by `Deadline Close`. This means the miner can be safely restarted before epoch 514, before the next deadline reaches.

    ```bash
    $ sudo lotus-miner proving info
    Miner: t01001
    Current Epoch:           500
    Proving Period Boundary: 154
    Proving Period Start:    154 (2h53m0s ago)
    Next Period Start:       3034 (in 21h7m0s)
    Faults:      768 (100.00%)
    Recovering:  768
    Deadline Index:       5
    Deadline Sectors:     0
    Deadline Open:        454 (23m0s ago)
    Deadline Close:       514 (in 7m0s)
    Deadline Challenge:   434 (33m0s ago)
    Deadline FaultCutoff: 384 (58m0s ago)
    ```

    In this next example, there are 768 sectors going to be challenged in epoch 658, as stated by `Deadline Open` and the `Current Epoch` is 497, it is are safe for you to upgrade your miner before epoch `658` and you have already submitted PoSt for the current deadline. 

    ```bash
    $ sudo lotus-miner proving info
    Miner: t01000
    Current Epoch:           497
    Proving Period Boundary: 658
    Proving Period Start:    658 (in 1h20m30s)
    Next Period Start:       3538 (in 25h20m30s)
    Faults:      0 (0.00%)
    Recovering:  0
    Deadline Index:       0
    Deadline Sectors:     768
    Deadline Open:        658 (in 1h20m30s)
    Deadline Close:       718 (in 1h50m30s)
    Deadline Challenge:   638 (in 1h10m30s)
    Deadline FaultCutoff: 588 (in 45m30s)
    ```

    After you find a good window, move to the next step!
* `Stop your nodes(daemon, miner/workers)`:
  * run
    ```bash
    lotus daemon stop
    lotus-miner stop
    ```
* `Get the latest version and build the new binary`: 
  * Navigate  to your lotus directory
  * run:
    ```bash
    git pull && git checkout <tag> 
    git submodule update
    make all && make install
    ``` 
    This should preserve your config, wallets, and anything else on disk.
* `Start daemon`: 
  * run: 
    ```bash
    lotus daemon
    ``` 
  * Check your syncing status by running 
    ```bash
    lotus sync wait
    ``` 
    `Done` in the output indicates you have been synced up with the network!
* `Start your miner`: 
  ```bash
  lotus-miner run
  ```
* `Start your worker(s)`:
  ```bash
  lotus-worker run
  ```
