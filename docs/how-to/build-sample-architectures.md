# Sample architectures

No matter what you wish to build on Filecoin, you'll generally need a few basic elements:

- **A node.** Each Filecoin-based service or application will need to use at least one Filecoin node that maintains consensus. All interactions with the network must flow through an up-to-date node: sending and receiving market deals, sending and receiving data, and more. You can host this yourself, or choose a [hosted node](/how-to/build-interacting-with-the-network/) option.
- **An API.** Depending on language, and your preference for more granular or high-level commands, you can either directly use the node's go RPC API, or use one of the available [JS API client libraries](/how-to/build-wallets-signing-tools-api-clients/#api-clients).
- Optional: Additional helper tools and libraries to simplify functions such as storage commands, managing deals, and more.
