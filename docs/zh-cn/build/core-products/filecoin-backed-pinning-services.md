# Filecoin-backed IPFS Pinning Services (FPS)

Filecoin-backed IPFS Pinning Services (FPS) are data storage and retrieval services that offer the performance and availability of IPFS alongside the data persistence features of Filecoin’s decentralized storage network (DSN). FPS solutions offer this functionality behind a single easy-to-use API.

FPS services offer a number of key benefits.

1. By storing your application data on an FPS, you are using a decentralized storage network (the Filecoin network) for data persistence.

2. Developers can interface with both IPFS and Filecoin nodes through a single FPS API, abstracting away some of the deal and file management patterns inherent to Filecoin. Developers can utilize Filecoin features, e.g. storage in different geographies, redundant copies, and cryptographic storage receipts without having to learn Filecoin protocol implementation APIs.
3. Like other IPFS pinning services, FPS services are often preferred alternatives to maintaining your own nodes on multiple peer-to-peer networks. FPS providers handle resource management and networking so application developers can focus on delivering a compelling user experience on web3 infrastructure.

**_FPS solutions are the recommended storage backend for most applications._** These solutions are especially targeted towards application developers coming from the IPFS and broader web3 ecosystems. Developers can use Filecoin-backed pinning services to achieve values of decentralization, resilience, and peer-to-peer networks while maintaining storage/retrieval performance and cost savings.

Those who prefer to maintain their own infrastructure can look to solutions like [Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate) or directly run [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) and [lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus) nodes.

## How to use an FPS

The following FPS solutions are live today:

- [**Textile Buckets**](https://docs.textile.io/buckets/): Textile Buckets is a hosted service that allows development teams to build software projects end-to-end on a decentralized DB and storage stack. Check out this recent blog post for some relevant features of Textile Buckets.
- **ChainSafe**: Coming soon (August 2020).
- **Pinata**: Filecoin persistence coming soon (August 2020), IPFS pinning available today.

While each FPS provider will have slightly different instructions for utilizing the service, the general flow remains the same:

- Create and configure your account with the FPS provider.
- Retrieve your auth token for the FPS provider.
- Make storage requests through the API of the service you are using.
- Maintain and monitor your data storage.
- Retrieve your data through the API of the service you are using.

This section will be updated with documentation links for additional FPS providers as they come online.

## How FPS solutions work

FPS solutions run IPFS and Filecoin software clients (e.g. [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) and [lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus)) under the hood, either communicating directly with these software clients through their native APIs or through tools like the [Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate) APIs. IPFS/Filecoin nodes speak libp2p protocols and transfer IPLD data back and forth. FPS services manage the flow of data between the IPFS DHT and Filecoin miners, employing intelligent caching strategies to keep popular data readily available.

The FPS stores and retrieves data from embedded go-ipfs and lotus nodes, which communicate with each other via libp2p and IPLD data formats.](../images/fps/fps-data-flows.png)

While the specific architecture of each service will look different, most FPS solutions follow similar flows behind-the-scenes.

**Data storage**:

- When a user makes an API request to store a particular CID through an FPS, the FPS will pin that CID to its node (which is connected to the public IPFS network) -- or the “Hot” storage layer.
- The FPS will simultaneously initiate Filecoin storage deals (“Cold” storage layer) to persist the data.
- If the user specifies a replication factor greater than 1 for their file (X redundant copies of the data), the FPS will initiate X separate Filecoin storage deals for the data.
- The user pays the FPS directly for providing this storage service.

**Data retrieval**:

- When a user makes an API request to retrieve a particular CID through an FPS, the FPS will attempt first to retrieve the CID through the “Hot” storage layer (pinned data on the public IPFS network).
- If this is unsuccessful, the FPS will then retrieve the CID through the “Cold” storage layer (data stored with miners on the Filecoin network) and serve it back to the requestor.
- The user pays the FPS directly for providing this retrieval service.

Remember that these flows are hidden from the user and take place behind the scenes. Users will interact with a single FPS API that abstracts away data flows between systems, node management, and Filecoin deal management.
