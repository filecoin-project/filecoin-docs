# Overview

In this tutorial, we will build a [meme marketplace](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/meme-marketplace) using [Textile Hub](https://docs.textile.io/hub/), which is a [Filecoin-backed IPFS Pinning Service](../../core-products/filecoin-backed-pinning-services.md), and Ethereum ERC 721 standard.

You will be able to upload memes to Textile Hub using a dashboard and register the memes with ERC 721 Non-fungible tokens, which will help anyone to uniquely identify the memes and their owners in a decentralized way!

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Write and deploy an ERC 721 standard contract to create and issue Non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
2. Use javascript libraries to connect to remote Textile Hub to add and retrieve data from Textile Buckets.
3. Use javascript libraries to connect to ethereum blockchain to interact with the deployed smart contract.

While the full tutorial is coming soon, check out this video to see the application in action.
