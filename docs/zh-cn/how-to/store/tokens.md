# Token payments

Youâ€™ll need Filecoin tokens (FIL) to pay for storage. Tokens are stored in digital wallets. Access to your tokens is governed by private cryptographic keys (basically, long random alphanumeric values). Digital wallets store these private keys for you, using a combination of software and/or hardware.

If you are using a core protocol implementation such as lotus or go-filecoin, each node automatically provisions a new Filecoin wallet with a balance of 0 FIL.

If you are using a different application, follow their instructions.

For Testnet usage, you can obtain mock FIL for free from the Filecoin faucet. Once Mainnet is live, you will be able to buy FIL on many exchanges, and transfer them to your digital wallet(s) as needed.
