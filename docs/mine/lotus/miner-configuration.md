{{ $frontmatter.description }}

The Lotus Miner configutation is created after the [initialization step](miner-setup.md) during setup and placed in `~/.lotusminer/config.toml` or `$LOTUS_MINER_PATH/config.toml` when defined.

The _default configuration_ has all the items commented, so in order to customize one of the items the leading `# ` need to be removed.

::: tip
For any **configuration changes to take effect**, the miner must be [restarted](daemon-lifecycle.md).

[[TOC]]

## API section

The API section controls the settings of the [miner API](../../reference/lotus-api.md):

```toml
[API]
  # Binding address for the miner API
  ListenAddress = "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/2345/http"
  # This should be set to the miner API address as seen externally
  RemoteListenAddress = "127.0.0.1:2345"
  # General network timeout value
  Timeout = "30s"
```

As you see, the listen address is bound to the local loopback interface by default. If you need to open access to the miner API to other machines, you will need to set this to the IP address of the network interface you want to use, or to `0.0.0.0` (which means "all interfaces"). Note that API access is still protected by [JWT tokens](../../build/lotus/api-token-generation.md) even when exposed.

Configure `RemoteListenAddress` to the value that a different node would have to use to reach this API. Usually it is the miner's IP address and API port, but depending on your setup (proxies, public IPs etc.), it might be a different IP.

## Libp2p section

This section configures the miner's embedded Libp2p node. As noted in the [setup instructions](miner-setup.md#connectivity-to-the-miner), it is very important to adjust this section with the miner's public IP and a fixed port:

```toml
# Binding address for the libp2p host. 0 means random port.
[Libp2p]
  ListenAddresses = ["/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0", "/ip6/::/tcp/0"]
  # Insert any addresses you want to explicitally
  # announce to other peers here. Otherwise, they are
  # guessed.
  AnnounceAddresses = []
  # Insert any addresses to avoid announcing here.
  NoAnnounceAddresses = []
  # Connection manager settings, decrease if your
  # machine is overwhelmed by connections.
  ConnMgrLow = 150
  ConnMgrHigh = 180
  ConnMgrGrace = "20s"
```

The connection manager will start to prune the existing connections if the number of established crosses the value set for `ConnMgrHigh` until it hits the value set for `ConnMgrLow`. Connections younger than `ConnMgrGrace` will be kept.

## Pubsub section

This section controls some Pubsub settings. Pubsub is used to distribute messages in the network:

```toml
[Pubsub]
  # Usually you will not run a pubsub bootstrapping node, so leave this as false
  Bootstrapper = false
  # FIXME
  RemoteTracer = ""
```

## Dealmaking section

This section controls parameters for making storage and retrieval deals:

```toml
[Dealmaking]
  # When enabled, the miner can potentially accept online deals
  ConsiderOnlineStorageDeals = true
  # When enabled, the miner can potentially accept offline deals
  ConsiderOfflineStorageDeals = true
  # When enabled, the miner can potentially accept retrieval deals
  ConsiderOnlineRetrievalDeals = true
  # When enabled, the miner can potentially accept offline retrieval deals
  ConsiderOfflineRetrievalDeals = true
  # A list made of Data CIDs to reject when making deals
  PieceCidBlocklist = []
  # How long the sealing process for a sector should take (see below)
  ExpectedSealDuration = "12h0m0s"
  # A filter expression to only accept very specific deals (see below)
  Filter = ""
```

`ExpectedSealDuration` is an estimate of how long sealing will take, and is used to reject deals whose start epoch might be earlier than the expected completion of sealing. It can be estimated by [benchmarking](benchmarks.md) or by [pledging a sector](sector-pledging.md).

:::warning
The final value of `ExpectedSealDuration` should equal `(TIME_TO_SEAL_A_SECTOR + WaitDealsDelay) * 1.5`. This equation ensures that the miner does not commit to having the sector sealed too soon.
:::

To filter deals based on certain parameters, modify the `Filter` param. This param should be a shell command that will be run when processing a deal proposal. Deals are accepted if the Filter's exit code is 0. For any other exit code, deals will be rejected. Set `Filter` to `false` to reject all deals and `true` to accept all deals. For example, the following filter only accepts deals from clients with specific addresses:

```sh
Filter = "jq -e '.Proposal.Client == \"t1nslxql4pck5pq7hddlzym3orxlx35wkepzjkm3i\" or .Proposal.Client == \"t1stghxhdp2w53dym2nz2jtbpk6ccd4l2lxgmezlq\" or .Proposal.Client == \"t1mcr5xkgv4jdl3rnz77outn6xbmygb55vdejgbfi\" or .Proposal.Client == \"t1qiqdbbmrdalbntnuapriirduvxu5ltsc5mhy7si\" '"
```

## Sealing section

This section controls some of the behaviour around sector sealing:

```toml
[Sealing]
  # Upper bound on how many sectors can be waiting for more deals to be packed in it before it begins sealing at any given time.
  MaxWaitDealsSectors = 2
  # Upper bound on how many sectors can be sealing at the same time (including pledges)
  MaxSealingSectors = 0
  # Same, but for deal-related sealing (pledge sectors not included)
  MaxSealingSectorsForDeals = 0
  # Period of time that a newly created sector will wait for more deals to be packed in to before it starts to seal.
  WaitDealsDelay = "1h0m0s"
```

## Storage section

The storage sector controls whether the miner can perform certain sealing actions. Depending on the setup and the use of additional [seal workers](seal-workers.md), you may want to modify some of the options.

```toml
[Storage]
  # Upper bound on how many sectors can fetch sector data at the same time
  ParallelFetchLimit = 10
  # Sealing steps that the miner can perform itself. Sometimes we have a dedicated seal worker to do them and do not want the miner to commit any resources for this.
  AllowPreCommit1 = true
  AllowPreCommit2 = true
  AllowCommit = true
  AllowUnseal = true
```

## Fees section

The fees section allows to set limits to the gas consumption for the different messages that are submitted to the chain by the miner:

```toml
[Fees]
  # Maximum fees to pay
  MaxPreCommitGasFee = "0.05 FIL"
  MaxCommitGasFee = "0.05 FIL"
  # This is a high-value operation, so the default fee is higher.
  MaxWindowPoStGasFee = "50 FIL"
```

Depending on the network congestion the base fee for a transaction may grow or decrease. Your gas limits will have to be at any case larger than the base fee for the messages to be included. A very large max fee can however result in the quick burning of funds when the base fees are very high, as the miner automatically submits messages during normal operation, so be careful about this.
