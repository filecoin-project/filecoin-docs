The sealing process automatically runs in the **Lotus Miner** process, but you can use the Worker on another machine communicating over a fast network to free up resources on the machine running the mining process.

[[TOC]]

## Installation

The `lotus-worker` application should have been built and installed along with the others when following the [installation guide](../../get-started/lotus/installation.md). For simplicity, we recommend following the same procedure in the machines that will run the Lotus Workers (even if the Lotus miner and the Lotus daemon are not used there).

## Setting up the Miner

### Allow external connections to the miner API

Set `ListenAddress` and `RemoteListenAddress` to the IP of a non-local interface (or `0.0.0.0`) as [documented here](miner-configuration.md#api-section). [Check connectivity to the RemoteListenAddress](connectivity.md) from the worker machine.

### Create an authentication token

```sh
lotus-miner auth api-info --perm admin
```

The Lotus Workers will need this token to connect to the miner. For more info check the [API docs](../../build/lotus/api-token-generation).

### Connect the Lotus Workers

On each machine that will run the `lotus-worker` application you will need to define the following _environment variable_:

```sh
export MINER_API_INFO:<TOKEN>:/ip4/<miner_api_address>/tcp/<port>`
```

::: tip
Remember to set the [`IPFS_GATEWAY` variable when running from China](tips-running-in-china.md)
:::

Once that is done, you can run the Worker with:

```sh
lotus-worker run
```

::: tip
If you are **running multiple workers on the same host**, you will need to specify the `--listen` flag and ensure each worker is on a different port.
:::

On your Lotus miner, check that the workers are correctly connected:

```sh
lotus-miner sealing workers
Worker 0, host computer
        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use
        RAM:  [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB
        VMEM: [||||||||||||||||||                                              ] 28% 18.1 GiB/62.7 GiB
        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used

Worker 1, host othercomputer
        CPU:  [                                                                ] 0 core(s) in use
        RAM:  [||||||||||||||                                                  ] 23% 14 GiB/62.7 GiB
        VMEM: [||||||||||||||                                                  ] 23% 14 GiB/62.7 GiB
        GPU: GeForce RTX 2080, not used
```

## Running locally for manually managing process priority

You can also run the _Lotus Worker_ on the same machine as your _Lotus Miner_, so you can manually manage the process priority.

To do so you have to first **disable all seal task types** in the [miner configuration](miner-configuration.md#storage-section). This is important to prevent conflicts between the two processes:

```toml
[Storage]
  AllowPreCommit1 = false
  AllowPreCommit2 = false
  AllowCommit = false
  AllowUnseal = false
```

Note that, if you do this, you do not need to open up the miner API and it can stay listening on the local interface.
