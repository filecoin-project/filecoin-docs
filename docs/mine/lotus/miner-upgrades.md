The are two types of upgrades. The _upgrade in-place_ is the default procedure and just updates the software. The _upgrade with reset_ removes all the data and starts from scratch:

[[TOC]]

## Upgrade in-place

1. Safely shutdown your Lotus Miner as explained [here](daemon-lifecycle.md).
1. Shutdown any seal workers
1. Shutdown your Lotus Node (`lotus daemon stop` or `systemctl stop lotus-daemon`)
1. Pull the new version and rebuild. For more information read the [Lotus installation guide](../../get-started/lotus/installation.md) again:

```sh
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native -g"
export FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1
git pull
git checkout <tag_or_branch>
git submodule update
make clean
make all
make install
```

1. Start the Lotus daemon and wait for sync:

```sh
lotus daemon
# or when using systemctl
systemctl start lotus-daemon
```

```sh
lotus sync wait
```

2. Start your miner and your workers

```sh
lotus-miner run
```

```sh
lotus-worker run
```

## Upgrade with reset

::: warning
This upgrade procedure should only be used as a last resort or when the chain has been upgraded and requires such action to be taken.
:::

It is similar to re-installing everything from scratch, so you can follow the usual [installation](../../get-started/lotus/installation.md) and [miner-setup](miner-setup.md) guides after it. Before you do this, consider:

- [Backing up your Lotus wallets](../../get-started/lotus/send-and-receive-fil/#exporting-and-importing-a-wallet)
- You may want to backup your Lotus Node and Miner configurations as well.

Once you are ready, stop everything and delete the data folders (or rename them):

```sh
# Assuming you are using the default data folders
rm -rf ~/.lotus
rm -rf ~/.lotusminer
rm -rf ~/.lotusworker
```

After that Lotus applications will start from scratch.
