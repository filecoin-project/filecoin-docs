# Mine

Welcome to the Filecoin documentation for **Miners**.

{{ $frontmatter.description }} Content in this section will help you to:

- Understand [how mining works](how-mining-works.md) and what different types of miners exist.
- Learn how miners get [rewards](mining-rewards.md) when doing their job properly, but also [slashed](slashing.md) when they are unable to honor deals they have made.
- Learn about different [mining architectures](mining-architectures.md).
- Setup and run a high performant [Lotus Miner](lotus/README.md).

The documentation you will be reading assumes you are familiar with the documentation in the [Get started](../get-started) section, have a general grasp of how Filecoin works and are familiar with Filecoin node software and tooling.

:::warning
Running a successful mining operation on Filecoin has high [hardware requirements](hardware-requirements.md) and, apart from a strong familiarity with Filecoin, requires experience in systems deployment and administration.
