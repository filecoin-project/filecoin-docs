# Improving connectivity

Filecoin miners, like participants in all peer-to-peer protocols, require a steady and quality pool of peers to communicate with in order to perform their various functions. For other participants on the network to establish incoming P2P connections with a miner, a few conditions must be met:

* The miner's public IP address must be known
* The protocol (TCP/UDP) and port number (0-65535) on which the miner is listening must be known 
* All routers & firewalls must be configured to allow incoming traffic on that protocol/port combination

The following steps are highly recommended for all miners who wish to successfully accept storage and retrieval deals.

## Setting multiaddresses

You can set the multiaddresses that your miner listens on in a miner's `config.toml` file 
(by default located at `~/.lotusminer/config.toml`). 

Once you've done so, you can set the on-chain record
of your miner's listen addresses with the command:
 
 ```
 lotus-miner set-addrs <multiaddr_1> <multiaddr_2> ... <multiaddr_n>
```

This updates the `MinerInfo` object in your miner's actor, which will be looked up
when a client attempts to make a deal with you. You can provide any number of addresses.

As an example, you could run:

```
 lotus-miner set-addrs /ip4/123.123.73.123/tcp/12345 /ip4/223.223.83.223/tcp/23456 
```

## Checking peer count

To ensure storage and retrieval deals operate smoothly, it is recommended to check how many peers a miner is connected to after each start-up. In the Lotus client, a manual peer check can be performed with the command:

```
lotus-miner net peers
``` 

If a very low peer count is present (1-5), it is possible to manually connect the miner to the DHT by utilising one of the bootstrap peers listed in the branch's `./build/bootstrap/bootstrappers.pi` file with the commmand:

```
lotus net connect <address from bootstrappers>
```

## Port forwarding

In order to ensure that Filecoin packets are able to pass freely and unfiltered through a local firewall, it is highly recommended to set up port forwarding for a miner's `libp2p` address. By default, this port is randomised; for optimal connectivity, make sure that it is set to a static IP. 

#### Option 1: Standard port forwarding

To enable port forwarding on your local router:

1. Browse to the management website for your home router (typically http://192.168.1.1)
2. Log in as admin / root
3. Find the section to configure port forwarding
4. Choose a port, and configure a port forwarding rule with the following values:
    * External port: [CHOSEN PORT]
    * Internal port: [CHOSEN PORT]
    * Protocol: TCP
    * IP Address: Private IP address of the host system running the miner

#### Option 2: UPnP setup

Alternatively, users with routers that support universal plug n' play (UPnP) can set up their firewalling automatically by configuring their client's daemon to use the address `0.0.0.0`. Note that, if using UPnP, **standard port forwarding does not need to be set up,** and can cause issues if used in parallel.  

## Setting a public IP address

To help storage and retrieval deals operate smoothly, it is recommended to add the host system's public IP address, as well as the port that was configured above, to the miner configuration file's `AnnounceAddresses` address list. DNS4 multi-address or IPV6 formats are also acceptable.

Below is an example configuration file in which the public IP address is `1.2.3.4`:

```
[Libp2p]
   ListenAddresses = ["/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/5472"]
   AnnounceAddresses = ["/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/10240"]
```
In the above example, port `10240` is forwarded to `<internal-miner-host-ip>:5472`.

It is possible to verify that the port is listening by using telnet (eg: `telnet 1.2.3.4 10240`. `nc` is also sufficient.) If successful, a plaintext `/multistream/1.0.0` line will be within the response.
