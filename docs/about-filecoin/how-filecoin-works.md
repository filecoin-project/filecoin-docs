# How Filecoin Works

This guide attempts to give an introductory overview of how the Filecoin network operates, and the different actors in it. Filecoin is similar to other crytocurrencies in some aspects, while bringing some novelty in others.

## The Network

The Filecoin network is a distributed, peer-to-peer network formed by Filecoin peers which participate on it in different fashions.

Peers communicate over secure channels that they use to distribute information to the network (gossiping), to transfer data among themselves and to discover other peer, maintaining a well connected swarm in which information like blocks and messages flows swiftly even when many thousands of peers participate.

## Filecoin nodes

_Filecoin Nodes_ or _Filecoin clients_ are peers that sync the Filecoin blockchain and validate the messages in every block, which once applied, provide a global state. Nodes can manage Filecoin wallets (addresses start with `t1...` or `t3...` and receive FIL on them.

Filecoin Nodes can also publish different types of _messages_ to the network by broadcasting them. For example, a client can publish a message to send FIL from one address to a different one. Nodes can propose [storage and retrieval deals](#deals) to Filecoin miners and pay for them as they are executed.

Running a Filecoin Node is a low-level task, that usually implies keeping a program running 24/7. There are several Filecoin Node implementations in the works, with [Lotus](../store/lotus/README.md) being the most advanced.

## Filecoin miners

The miners provide services to the network by executing different types of [deals](#deals) and appending new blocks to the chain (every 30 seconds) to the chain, for which they collect FIL rewards. Additional details about types of miners, rewards and deals execution from the miner perspective can be found in the [How mining works](../mine/how-mining-works.md) section.

Running a Filecoin miner is a highly-technical task with strong [hardware requirements](../mine/hardware-requirements.md), as needed to complete the necessary [proofs](#proofs). The [Lotus Miner](../mine/lotus/README.md) is the most advanced implementation of a Filecoin miner to this day.

## Deals

There are two main types of deals in Filecoin: _storage deals_ and _retrieval deals_.

_Storage deals_ are agreements between clients and _storage miners_ to store some data in the network. Once a deal is initiated and the miner has received the data to store, it will repeteadly [prove](#proofs) to the chain that it is still storing the data per the agreement, so that it can collect [rewards](../mine/mining-rewards.md). If not, the miner will be [slashed](../mine/slashing.md) and lose FIL.

_Retrieval deals_ are agreements between clients and _retrieval miners_ (which may or not be also storage miners) to extract data that is stored in the network (hopefully in a fast and reliable manner). Unlike storage deals, these deals are fulfilled off chain, using _payment channels_ to incrementally pay for the data received.

## Proofs

As mentioned above, storage miners must prove that they are storing the data per the terms of a deal. That means that:

- They must store all the data submitted by the client
- They must store it during the whole lifetime of the deal

Cryptographic proofs are used to these ends, as explained in this article about the [Filecoin proof system](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-proof-system/).

Using _Proof Of Replication (PoRep)_, miners demonstrate that they have received all the data and that they have encoded it in a way unique to that miner using their physical storage in a way that no other miner can replicate (so two deals for the same data cannot end up re-using the same disk). This proof is provided when the deal starts and the _sealing_ operation completes.

Once a deal is active, and during its full lifetime, the miner will use _Proof of Spacetime (PoSt)_ to prove that it is _still_ storing the data associated to a deal. For PoST, random miners need to prove that random parts of the data they store is still there.

Filecoin clients and other miners continuously verify that the proofs included in each block are valid, providing the necessary security and penalizing miners that do not honor their deals.

## Additional materials

Filecoin is built on top of [mature projects](../project/related-projects/) like libp2p (networking, addressing, message distribution), IPLD (data formats, encoding and content-addressed data structures), IPFS (data transfers) and Multiformats (future-proof data types).
