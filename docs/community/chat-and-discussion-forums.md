# Chat & Discussion Forums

The Filecoin community is active and here to answer your questions in your channel of choice.

## Chat (Slack or Matrix)

For shorter-lived discussions, our community chat open to all on both Slack and Matrix, with bridged channels allowing you to particate in the same conversations from either platform:
- [Slack](https://filecoin.io/slack/)
- [Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+filecoin:matrix.org)

## Discussion Forums

For long-lived discussions and for support, please use the discussion forums at [https://discuss.filecoin.io/](https://discuss.filecoin.io/) instead of Slack or Matrix. It’s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on those chat platforms, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums helps future visitors, too.
