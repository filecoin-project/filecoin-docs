# How is Filecoin Governed? 
***WORK IN PROGRESS*** - *Please note that the following information is designed to support [proposed changes to FIP0001](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/pull/850)  This information is thus tentative until [FIPXXXX](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/pull/850) completes Last Call.* 
## The FIPs Process 
The [Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs) process is the central mechanism of Filecoin protocol governance. 

FIPs are *policy documents* that openly describe a change or enhancement to the FIlecoin protocol.  Changes to consensus -dependent network systems can ONLY be implemented after the appropriate FIPs procedure has been completed.
