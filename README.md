This repository organizes overall documentation issues across the Filecoin project.

**If you'd just like to read the Filecoin docs, we recommend the website version of the info contained in this repo! https://docs.filecoin.io/**

## Get involved

We would **love ❤️ your help** to improve existing items or make new ones even better!


### Issues

If you find something wrong within this repository, please raise an [issue here →](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs/issues). Unless the issue is urgent, updates will be batch-merged into `main` on Tuesdays or Thursdays.

If you are attempting to close an issue, great! Thanks for the help! Please leave a comment within the issue requesting to be assigned to that issue **before** submitting a pull request. This minimizes the chance of multiple different contributors duplicating work by submitting pull requests for the same issue. If you submit a pull request to an issue _without_ first being assigned to it, that pull request may not be accepted.

### Suggestions

Everyone has an opinion when it comes to docs, and **that's a good thing**! Having folks from different backgrounds add to a discussion empowers everyone within that discussion. So if you've got something to add or would like to bring up a topic for discussion about the Filecoin Docs project, please do so! [Just create an issue using the `kind/discussion` tag!](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs/labels/kind%2Fdiscussion).

#### Pull requests welcome

Feel free to submit pull requests with any changes you'd like to see! If you're simply changing a typo or editing out a styling bug, you can add `ciskip` to the title of your pull request to stop Filecorgi from running.
