This repository manages the documentation for the Filecoin project. This repo also contains the build scripts and tools to create the Filecoin docs website and the API documentation. If you want to learn about Filecoin, how it works, or how to build on it, then you're in the right place.

### Files and folders

This section lists the various files and folders and defines the purpose for each of them.

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.git`, `.github` | Manage the git configurations and contain information for GitHub constant integrations. |
| `README.md` | This file. Acts as an introduction to this repo and how to spin up a local copy of the `docs.filecoin.io` site. |
| `archetypes/` | Used by Hugo to programmatically create new pages. |
| `assets/` | Assets like JavaScript and fonts used by Hugo to create the static site. These assets are not explorable in a built site. You must reference them in code before building the site. |
| `babel.config.js` | A configuration file used for the Babel JS compiler. |
| `config/` | Contains the configuration files for Hugo. You can manage things like the top-bar menu and site title within this directory. |
| `content/` | This is where all the `.md` files live that control the content of this site. Most contributions happen in this directory. |
| `data/` | You can supply extra variables for Hugo to use when building pages in this directory. These variables act just like front-matter variables. See [Data Templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/) in the Hugo docs for more info. |
| `functions/` | Functions callable from any template, partial, or shortcode within Hugo. |
| `i18n/` | Contains files specific to managing different languages. |
| `layouts/` | This is where web developers will likely spend most of their time. This folder contains the shortcodes and partials that Hugo uses to scaffold and build the site. |
| `node_modules/` | Where NPM throws its packages. If you see this in GitHub, something's gone wrong. It should only exist on your computer after you run `npm install`. |
| `package-lock.json` | One of the NPM configuration files. Specify which version of packages to download. |
| `package.json` | Another one of the NPM configuration files. Specifies which packages to download but doesn't specify which _version_ of the package to grab.
| `resources/` | A cache where Hugo throws generated files like CSS and JSON after `npm run build` has been called. Unless `npm run clean` is called, Hugo will re-use these files when calling `npm run build`. |
| `static/` | Images, CSS, fonts, and other misc files available at `docs.filecoin.io/` when the site is built. For example, `docs.filecoin.io/site.webmanifest`.
| `theme.toml` | A Hugo configuration file that specifies which theme to use. This file should not change that often. |

### Video guides for site management

Here's a collection of guides you can use to help manage and contribute to this site:

- [Managing the top-bar navigation](https://bafybeidn4wxz44rssgdlu3p2dzh4tbyevuqd27xv7avioyf2m65jzlhnj4.ipfs.w3s.link/DaaS%20-%20Managing%20the%20topbar%20navigation%20-%20HD%201080p.mov)
- [Move a page and add a redirect](https://bafybeibuwipv4rk2tzcqvouu2xlnebh4d7ol47mvmegtispbvlcruuwmhi.ipfs.w3s.link/Move%20and%20page%20and%20add%20a%20redirect.mp4)

### Front-matter variables 

The front-matter is that small section of metadata you can find at the top of each `.md` file within the [`/content` folder](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs/tree/main/content/en). Each variable has a specific purpose, and while not all are necessary, it's useful to know what they do and why they exist. 

```YAML
---
title: "Get started"
description: "The Filecoin Network is made with storage providers and clients. They make deals and contribute to maintaining the Filecoin blockchain, obtaining storage services, and receiving rewards in the process. This section walks you through how to get started, build a node, and create a simple application."
lead: "The Filecoin Network is made with storage providers and clients. They make deals and contribute to maintaining the Filecoin blockchain, obtaining storage services, and receiving rewards in the process. This section walks your through how to get started, build a node, and create a simple application."
menu:
    getstarted:
        parent: "getstarted-overview"
aliases:
    - /get-started
    - /how-to/install-filecoin
---
```

It's also good to note that we use the YAML as our front-matter format. We could use [JSON or TOML](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter#front-matter-formats) if we really wanted, but we found YAML the easiest to read. Plus, _yammal_ is fun to say.

This list has been created in order of commonality; variables you will come across most often are closer to the top of this list.

#### Title

The `title` variable defines what the `<h1>` tag on this page will say, along with the contents of `<title>` in this page's `<head>`. This variable also defines what is shown as the sidebar item; however, this can be overwritten in the `menus` config file.

```YAML
---
title: "Get started"
---
```

![](./static/images/front-matter-variables-title.png)

#### Description

The `description` variable defines what is in the [meta `<description>`](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description) tag within the `<head>` tag of this page's HTML.  This description often shows up in search engine results, and social network embeds. This description is meant to give the reader an idea of the content on this page and how it relates to their search query.

```YAML
---
description: "The Filecoin Network is made with storage providers and clients. They make deals and contribute to [...]"
---
```

![](./static/images/front-matter-variables-description.png)

#### Lead

The `lead` variable defines the content of the first paragraph on a page. This is usually an introduction, informing the reader what this page is referring to, what they're about to learn, and any prerequisites for understanding the content on this page. Often, the content of this variable is the same as the `description` variable.

```YAML
---
lead: "The Filecoin Network is made with storage providers and clients. They make deals and contribute to [...]"
---
```

![](./static/images/front-matter-variables-lead.png)

#### Weight

The `weight` variable defines where this page or menu item should be in a menu. The lower the number, the closer to the start of the menu this page will be. If set, `weight` should be non-zero, as `0` is interpreted as an unset weight. There is no upper limit for a weight value.

In the top-bar menu, a lower number will cause the menu item to be further to the left in a regular view or further to the top in a mobile view.

This example is from the `/config/_default/menus/menus.en.toml` file:

```
[[main]]
  name = "About Filecoin"
  url = "/about-filecoin/what-is-filecoin"
  weight = 10
  
[[main]]
  name = "Networks"
  url = "/networks/overview"
  weight = 20

[[main]]
  name = "Get started"
  url = "/get-started/overview"
  weight = 30
```

![](./static/images/front-matter-variables-weight-1.png)

In the sidebar menu, a lower number will cause the menu item or page to be higher up.

![](./static/images/front-matter-variables-weight-2.png)

The weight of a page also defines the _next_ and _previous_ buttons at the bottom of the page. The _previous_ page will be the page with the closest weight _below_ the current page's weight. The _next_ page will be the page with the closest weight _above_ the current page's weight.

![](./static/images/front-matter-variables-weight-3.png)

#### Menu

The `menu` variable defines which sidebar menu this page is assigned to, along with which sub-menu this page falls under. This variable is made of three parts:

1. The `menu` delimiter. This tells Hugo that were are about to define the menu object for this page.
1. The section/top-bar menu that this page falls under.
1. The sub-menu within the sidebar that this page falls under.

```YAML
---
menu:
    store:
        parent: "store-filecoin-plus"
---
```

##### Sidebar menu

Each section has its own sidebar menu. The name of each sidebar menu is usually a lowercase version of the name of the section. For sections that contain a space, the sidebar menu name is a lowercase version of the section without the space:

| Section | Sidebar menu name |
| --- | --- |
| About Filecoin | `about` |
| Build | `build` |
| Get started | `getstarted` |
| Networks | `networks` |
| Reference | `reference` |
| Storage provider | `storageprovider` |
| Store | `store` |


```YAML
---
menu:
    storageprovider:
---
```

##### Sub-menu

You can think of a sub-menu as the dropdown item in the sidebar menu. Sub-menus are defined in `/config/\_default/menus/menus.en.toml`. 
Each sub-menu is a _child_ of a sidebar menu. A sidebar menu can contain multiple sub-menus, but a sub-menu can only belong to one sidebar menu.

Sub-menus are made up of:

- `name`: The visible text shown to the user.
- `weight`: How high or low this sub-menu is shown within the sidebar.
- `identifier`: A unique string used in the front-matter to specify this particular sub-menu.
- `url`: The default page a user will go to if they click on this sub-menu link.

```YAML
[[about]]
  name = "Basics"
  weight = 10
  identifier = "about-filecoin-basics"
  url = "/about-filecoin/what-is-filecoin"

...

[[networks]]
  name = "Overview"
  weight = 10
  identifier = "networks-overview"
  url = "/networks/"

...

[[getstarted]]
  name = "Overview"
  weight = 1 
  identifier = "getstarted-overview"
  url = "/get-started/overview/"
```

To assign a page to a sub-menu, you must supply both the menu object name and the `identifier` value into the front-matter:

```YAML
menu:
    getstarted:
        parent: "getstarted-overview"
```

The identifier of each sub-menu is usually the menu object name and the title of the sub-menu, all in lowercase with dashes `-`:

![](/.static/images/front-matter-variables-sub-menus.png)

#### Aliases

The `aliases` variable defines URLs will rediect to this page. Each page can have multiple `aliases`, but each alias can only apear once throughout all the `.md` files within the `/content` folder.

For example, the `/get-started/overview` page can list `/get-started` as one of its aliases. However, no other page can list `/get-started` as an alias. If you attempt to assign another page the `/get-started` alias, Hugo will throw an error when you or Fleek try to build the website.

Aliases only work for internal links. You cannot assign a redirect to an external website using an alias.

```YAML
---
aliases:
    - /get-started
    - /how-to/install-filecoin
---
```

#### Draft

The `draft` variable, when set to `true`, will hide the page from all site navigation. The page will still be accessible by visiting its URL. If this variable is not set, Hugo will assume that it is set to `false`.

```YAML
draft: true
```

This feature is generally used when we need to share content that isn't fully complete, but some users could benefit from its information at this exact moment.
