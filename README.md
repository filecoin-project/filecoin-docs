# Filecoin Docs


**View conceptual documenation for the Filecoin project at [docs.filecoin.io](https://docs.filecoin.io/).** You may also be interested in Filecoin's [technical specifcation](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/) or the implementation details provided in the [go-filecoin tutorial](https://go.filecoin.io/go-filecoin-tutorial) or [lotus tutorial](https://lotu.sh). 

This repo generates the new conceptual Filecoin documentation at [docs.filecoin.io](https://docs.filecoin.io/), building off of the work done in [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) by the IPFS Docs team to create their [spiffy new IPFS docs site](https://docs-beta.ipfs.io/) (in beta).

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b3586cdd-c0e3-404c-b451-875025e0e990/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/filecoin-docs/deploys)

## Code organization
- Content lives in Markdown files in the `docs` folder. Each major section has its own subfolder.
- Navigation is generated from [docs/.vuepress/config.js](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/config.js) and the metadata within each Markdown file. Be sure to create an entry in this config file when adding new content.
- To feature a new article on the homepage, you'll also need to update the `manualSidebar` object in the Home component at [docs/.vuepress/themes/components/Home.vue](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/theme/components/Home.vue).
