We use `p` tags to define the priority of an issue. The priority is defined by the docs team using the following definitions:

| P0 | Severely business-impacting | Same day. Drop everything and fix it immediately. | The website is down. |
| P1 | Business-impacting. | Within three days. | The API endpoint for a project is about to change. |
| P2 | Planned project request. | Within two weeks. | A new method will soon be added to a project API. |
| P3 | Suggestion or conceptual update. | No due date. | A blog post discussing the benefits of decentralization for web developers. |
| P4 | Deprioritized suggestions. These will not be addressed unless significant activity or community requests are received. | No due date. | Translate the docs into Klingon. |
