Before you can do anything as a Storage Provider on the network you will have to create FIL wallets and add FIL to them. This is used to send messages to the blockchain but is also used for collateral. Providing storage capacity to the network requires you to provide FIL as collateral, which goes into a locked wallet <!-- TODO STEF when? how? how much--> on your miner instance. The [Lotus documentation](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/addresses/) details the process of setting up your wallets and funding wallets for the initial setup. Filecoin uses upfront token collaterals, as in proof-of-stake protocols, proportional to the storage hardware committed. This gets the best of both worlds to protect the network: attacking the network requires both acquiring and running the hardware, but it also requires acquiring large quantities of the token. <!-- TODO STEF what is attacking the network? I'm here to provide storage? Should I be worried-->

## Types of collateral
To satisfy the multiple needs for collateral in a way that is minimally burdensome to Storage Providers, Filecoin includes three different collateral mechanisms: initial pledge collateral, block reward as collateral, and storage deal provider collateral. The first is an initial commitment of filecoin that a miner must provide with each sector. The second is a mechanism to reduce the initial token commitment by vesting block rewards over time. The third aligns incentives between miner and client, and can allow miners to differentiate themselves in the market. <!--TODO STEF needs more explanation or linking? is the second basically re-investing earned blocks to give greater future capacity?--> 

For more detailed information about how collateral requirements are calculated, see the [miner collateral section in the Filecoin spec](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_mining/miner_collaterals/).

When a Storage Provider fails to answer to the WindowsPoSt challenges within the 30 minute deadline (see [Storage Proving]({{<relref "storage-proving" >}})) or when you take your storage offline and thereby break the rules of the storage deal, you will get penalized against the provided collateral. This penalty is called [slashing]({{<relref slashing>}}) and means a portion of the pledged collateral is forfeited <!--TODO STEF where does it go? who gets it? Does it all go? -->and your storage power is reduced.

## How much collateral?
The amount of required collateral depends on the amount of storage pledged to the Filecoin network. The bigger volume you store, the more collateral is required. Providing collateral for multiple PiBs of data is not cheap. Filecoin Plus <!--TODO STEF are there others?--> uses a [QAP](https://docs.filecoin.io/reference/general/glossary/#quality-adjusted-storage-power) multiplier increase the collateral requirement equal to the multiplier. See [Verified Deals with Filecoin Plus]({{<relref "verified-deals" >}}) for more information on that.

The formula for the required collateral is:

{{< alert  >}}
_Collateral needed for X TiBs = (Current Sector Initial Pledge) x (32) x (X TiBs)_

So for instance for 100TiB at a 0.20FIL / 32GiB sector this means:

_0.20FIL x 32 x 100 = 640 FIL_
{{< /alert >}}
<!--TODO STEF a table here might be better-->

The â€œCurrent Sector Initial Pledge" can be found on blockchain explorers like [Filfox](https://filfox.info/en) and [Filscout](https://www.filscout.com/en).

The ecosystem does have [FIL Lenders](https://filecoin-lending.com/) who can provide you FIL (but with interest) to get you started which you can pay back over time and with the help of earned block rewards. Every lender will require you to hold 20% of the required collateral though. The introduction of [FVM]({{<relref "auxiliary-services" >}}), in March 2023, will allow a new lending model on Filecoin in the near future.
