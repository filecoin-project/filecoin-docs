One way of contributing to the Filecoin network is by providing so-called “Committed Capacity” (CC) sectors to the network. Those sectors do not contain customer data but are filled with random data when they are created. The goal for the Filecoin network is to have a distributed network of verifiers and collaborators to the network in order to run and maintain a healthy blockchain network. Any public blockchain network requires enough participants that take part in the consensus mechanism of the blockchain to guarantee that transactions being logged onto the blockchain are legitimate. Because Filecoin’s consensus mechanism is based on Proof-of-Storage we need a vast amount of Storage Providers that pledge capacity to the network and thus take part in the consensus process. The first method to do so is through Committed Capacity sectors. This can be done in sectors of 32GiB or 64GiB. More on this will be discussed in the [architectural overview]({{<relref "lotus-components" >}}).

## Availability requirements
Because the Filecoin network needs consistency, a Storage Provider is required to  keep their capacity online. WindowPoSt verification will verify this capacity remains online. If not, a Storage Provider will get slashed (penalized) over the collateral they provided for that capacity and their storage power gets reduced. This means an immediate reduction in capital (lost FIL) but also a reduction in future earnings because block rewards are correlated to storage power, as explained above. See chapters [Storage Proving]({{<relref "storage-proving" >}}) and [FIL Collateral]({{<relref "fil-collateral" >}}) for more information.

## What's next?
Committed Capacity is the easiest way to get started as a Storage Provider but the economics of such a business are very dependent on the price of FIL. When FIL is priced low it is not profitable to only provide Committed Capacity. This is where [Filecoin Plus]({{<relref "verified-deals" >}}) comes in along with [extra services you can charge for]({{<relref "auxiliary-services" >}}) as a Storage Provider.

I edited this for review.
