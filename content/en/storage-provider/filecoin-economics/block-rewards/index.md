WinningPoSt (short for [Winning Proof of SpaceTime](https://spec.filecoin.io/algorithms/pos/post/)) is the cryptographic challenge through which storage providers are rewarded for their contributions to the network. At the beginning of each epoch (1 epoch = 30 seconds), a small number of storage providers are elected by the network to mine new [blocks](https://docs.filecoin.io/reference/general/glossary/#block). Each elected storage provider who successfully creates a block is granted Filecoin tokens by means of a _block reward_. The amount of FIL per block reward varies over time, and is listed on various blockchain explorers like [Filfox](https://filfox.info/en).

The election mechanism of the Filecoin network is based on the “storage power” of the storage providers. A minimum of 10TiB in storage power is required to be eligible for WinningPoSt, and hence to earn block rewards. The more storage power a storage provider has, the more likely they will be elected to mine a block. This concept becomes incredibly advantageous in the context of [Filecoin Plus verified deals](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus/).
