Being successful at running a Storage Provider business depends on multiple factors. Having the right technical skills and team is one of them, but not all. It's also important to have business and commercial skills and experience.

## Business aspects
Running a Storage Provider business means investing in both hardware and FIL to use as collateral. The sum of both budgets can be a significant amount of money, and growing your business will easily bring those budgets well beyond your initial hardwar investment budget.

Working with such budgets requires skilled business people, capable of running a business at scale. It also likely means interacting with investors, venture capitalists, banks etc. None of those actors will be keen to invest into your business, unless you have a skilled team on board.

## Commercial aspects
A Storage Provider needs to get storage deals to grow his network power and to earn money. There are at least 2 ways to get storage deals, each one requiring specific sales skills.

- Obtaining data replicas from other Storage Providers and programs:

  Filecoin data programs specify the minimum amount of replicas for a deal. Programs like Slingshot and platforms like Estuary require a minimum of 6 replicas per deal. This means deals need to be stored across multiple Storage Providers in the ecosystem, so you can work with peers in the network to share clients' data replicas.

  Working in the ecosystem and building connections with other Storage Providers takes time and effort, and is essentially a sales activity.

- Onboarding your own customers:

Acquiring your own customers, and bringing their data onto the Filecoin network, requires business development skills and people on your team who actively work with data owners (customers) to educate them about the advantages of decentralized storage.
  
  It takes additional effort to work with customers and their data, but it has the additional advantage of being able to charge your customer for the data being stored. This means an additional revenue stream compared to only storing copies of deals, and earning block rewards.
