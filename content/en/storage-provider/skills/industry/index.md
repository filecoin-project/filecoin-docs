When working with customers from certain industries, certain requirements might apply. Think of certifications and compliance standards like:
<!--TODO STEF TREY link all these-->

- HIPAA for medical data
- SOC2 for service providers
- [PCI-DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) if you are handling payments
- SOX for doing business in the financial sector
- GDPR for European data privacy regulation, if you're storing personally identifiable information (PII)
- local regulations that vary per country (especially when doing business with the government)
- ISO 27001 security standards

Having one or more of these certifications will allow you to work directly with a different set of customers.
