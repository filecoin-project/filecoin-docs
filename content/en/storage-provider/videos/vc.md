### Don't Raise Venture Capital

Its a bit of tongue-in-cheek, but venture capital is not a good deal for a lot of businesses. As soon as you raise capital, you are essentially selling part of the company. You lose some control of the business, and the investors are your boss. The investors themselves may not have a lot of experience actually operating a business and you are sharing control of business operations with them. 

The moment you accept VC funding, you enter what I like to call the “VC rat race”. You will always be fundraising after the first round of funding. Typically, what happens, like a clock, every 12 months, you are back on the road raising the next round of funding. This continues until you reach IPO or some other type of exit. 

There are good reasons to raise VC funding. If you require significant amounts of capital to reach MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or you are broke and cannot pay your rent. However, most of the time the money raised through VCs is only part of the equation. Entrepreneurs often seek mentorship, networking, experience, and credibility. A VC can bring all this to a company and help expand and grow the business with the entrepreneur.

There are many companies who started with VC funding and are successful. Here are a few examples.

Apple is a multi-trillion dollar company and they started with VC funding. Microsoft also started with VC funding, although a much smaller amount.

### A Bold Idea

It has to be a billion dollar business. You often hear that, but what does that actually mean? 

- Translation: This company will IPO (or exit to a public company)
- Assuming 10X multiple on revenues → $100MM annual revenue opportunity
- Investors want (and need) to 10X their investment
    - ONE breakout success needs to pay for nine failures.
- Not just a little better, but 10X better.
- Monopoly Opportunities**

### A Clear Idea

> “If you cant tell the story of the company in five minutes then you’re either overthinking it or you haven’t simplified it down enough.”
> 

The elevator pitch: 

- Less than 30 seconds
    - “We are a web platform where users can rent out their space to host travelers to save money when traveling, make money when hosting, and share culture through local connections to the city.”
- Ideally.. one sentence
    - “We allow users to book rooms with locals, rather than hotels.”
- Really ideally, a sentence fragment
    - “Air Bed and Breakfast”

You need to be able to simplify you message and tell the mission of the company as precise and to the point as possible. This helps in VC meetings as well as during your normal life. 

### What are VC’s looking for?

From zero, investors look for a bold, clear, venture-backable idea with a great story. From there, the question becomes, why now? Is it something the market needs now? 

Once you have passed those barrier questions, you have to prove you have the right team and a great product. Timing and ideas will not go far if you do not have the right team on board. 

A competitive Advantage is the next hurdle. How do you plan to beat your competitors and mitigate risk? 

Now we know what we need to talk to VCs, but how do we present that? 

### The Deck

First, do not put together a business plan as part of your presentation. VCs see hundreds of presentations a year and they will not read through your entire business plan. They want to see a deck, as its an ideal format to present an idea in a crisp and clean format. At minimum, it should include the following. 

- Mission/Purpose - What do you do? What is your mission?
- Problem - The world has a problem
- Solution - We have a solution
- Why Now - Today is the time to solve that problem

A good deck will be less than 10 slides and some say you can capture everything in six slides. You want to include your mission, an explanation of your mission (ideally in a sentence) and an explanation of what problem you are solving in the world. You will need to show who your competition is, how you will beat them. Last but not least, a team intro so they know who you are working with.

(include references to example decks)

### How do you find investors

The easiest way to find investors is through other investors. Your initial investor during your seed round needs to be a strong investor that really has your back. But how do you meet that first investor? Networking events, accelerators, and y-combinators are all great ways to get to find a number of investors that you can start to work with. Remember that experience and council from your investor is the best option for your business and the money they bring is simply a added benefit. 

There is such a thing as good money and bad money. Not all money is equal, it will keep the lights on, but it will lack the mentorship and counsel to grow the business. 

### The pitch meeting

Shark Tank does a surprisingly good job at what a pitch meeting is actually like. The big difference is that you see the investors fight with each other as that doesn’t seem to happen in actual pitch meetings. Note that most investors or VCs are not like Mr. Wonderful. He has a TV personality and I haven’t met an investor like that. 

VCs on Shark Tank will tell you no on the spot. In real life, VCs tend to avoid telling you know directly. They will normally avoid you and not respond after your pitch. 

So what does success look like in a pitch meeting? The Term Sheet is the goal. 

### The Term Sheet

A term sheet is a nonbinding agreement that shows the basic terms and conditions of an investment. 

- Lead/Co-Lead Investors - The VCs who together define the terms of the deal.
- Follows - The VCs who join the round without dictating the terms of the deal.
- Angels - An independently wealthy individual who joins the round.
- Strategics - A non-VC, company or firm who joins the round.
    - It is a bad idea to rely on Angels or Strategics to lead a round (Why)?

The mission of a strategic investor is different from that of a VC. A venture capitalist's mission is more aligned with the business. They want to grow and expand the business. A strategic investor is only with you as long as your interests aligns. If you business interests are not in the best interests of the strategic investor, they not go any further. Stick with VCs as they will be more willing to adjust and align with the business as time goes on. 

### Fundraising Timeline

Once you accept funding from a VC, expect to be doing so again on a constant basis. For long periods of time, you will be traveling around to various events to raise further funding. To help reduce this travel and fundraising time period, you want to raise capital for 18-24 months. 

- Raise enough to operate for at least 12 months without fundraising
- Reserve 6 months for the next funding round
- In reality, a CEO is always preparing to fundraise

The funding periods or proof points have various names associated with number of times your company has sought and received funding and the stage in which the company record exists. Generally they are named as seen below. 

- Seed - SAFE or convertible note. Emphasis on idea and team. Pre-revenue
- Series A - First priced round. You have revenue and strong evidence of product/market fit
- Series B - First growth round. You have a product/market fit and are starting to scale up.
- Series C - IPO - Grow, scale, and run, run, run to $1B

### Conclusion

A business needs funds to start and grow. A VC can provide those funds and is suitable for certain situations. Other investor types can also fund a business, but each type of investor, VC or not comes with its own set of challenges. Once you have come to an agreement with a VC or investor, the funding life of your company will go through various phases. Work through each phase with an understanding of your mission and target.  

A business can only succeed with proper leadership. Make sure that your investors are on your side and will go down with the ship. Look to them for networking and leadership and if everything works out with your bold idea, you will be successful in your endeavors.
