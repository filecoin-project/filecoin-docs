### History and Web3

In early 2012, large market players were being asked about how they were going to support and integrate with cloud storage. Those same questions are now being asked about Web3. The difference now is that its all about web3 and decentralized storage. This brings in storage companies such as Seagate and allows us to work with many entities throughout the community.

### Evolution of data storage Web2 to Web3

The first systems that Google built were a lot of cables, zip ties, and duct tape. This is a stark difference between what Google and cloud datacenters look like today.

The rise of Web3 looks very similar. The early mining hardware was made of a lot of cables and zip ties. Now, Web3 is starting to look like a migration to a large, organized, global storage network.

### Crypto to catalyze the deployment of Web3

Cryptocurrencies plays a large role in the Web3 ecosystem, along with verifiability, user apps, NFTs, defi, and gaming. From the perspective from Seagate, Filecoin is the fundamental storage layer for Web3 and we want to participate by offering products and services that benefit the storage layer in Web3.

We believe in Filecoin is the growth indicators and amount of data already being stored by the Filecoin network. Juan talked about Filecoin Plus, and we are seeing more and more valuable data moving into that space. Business are building on top of Filecoin, which means more new commerce is coming to the network. We also really like the number of developers on the blockchain. Filecoin is the 4th most developed blockchain in the world. All of these are indicators of strong network and excitement for Web3.

### Web3 Ecosystem Map - Filecoin Centric

We started mapping out the Web3 ecosystem and the software stacks, blockchains, and layers that make up storage, data migration and bridges from web2 to web3. Accelerator programs like ESPA are the fertilizer that will help these ecosystems grow. Long term, the applications themselves will be the fruit of the tree that Filecoin and Web3 built.

### Data Storage Systems

Seagate offers high density and high capacity storage systems for the Filecoin network. These systems are self healing, easy to manage, and optimized for disk management. Our Exos system would be a great addition to any storage provider.

Seagate also offers mobile solutions that can me plugged into a rack and enable mass data transfers. When you have limited network bandwidth and need to move large amounts of data onboard, Lyve Mobile will be very helpful.
