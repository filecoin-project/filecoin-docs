### Building the Future Service Providers of Web3

Stefaan Vervaet, Head of Ecosystems and Partnerships at Protocol Labs, describes the role Protocol Labs and Filecoin have to play in the storage market. Stefaan covers the way Protocol Labs assists storage providers, the history of storage, the current and future market, and how the Filecoin protocol incentivizes participation.

### The storage landscape has evolved

A decentralized storage network is the next evolution of the storage story. Historically, storage has moved along with the technology that supports it. From direct attached storage to network attached storage and now cloud storage, the act of storing data is ever changing. 

Storage requirements are growing across the market. The IDC believes the current demand will go from 50 Zettabytes in 2020 to 175 Zettabytes by 2025. This new data will need to be stored and will look for the best storage services. 

Initially, there was a lot of skepticism about cloud storage but the market demand has grown year over year. In 2019 more than 58% of all enterprise data was stored on the cloud. In 2021, the cloud market consumed more than 82% of all enterprise data. Filecoin finds itself in a similar position as the available storage and and data stored on it has grown exponentially. 

### A New Wave of Web3 data and dApps is arriving

Last year, the NFT market exploded and Filecoin is now storing 35 Million + NFTs. Every digital asset in the future should be stored as a NFT and more NFTs mean more demand for storage. Data Daos are also getting bigger and we want to speak to people who want to run data Dao. Protocol Labs is happy to help out with various levels of sponsorships and grants for those who want to build Doas and other Web3 dApps. 

### Filecoin as a protocol

Filecoin brings immutability and decentralization to the storage industry. This gives Filecoin a competitive edge against the incumbent cloud providers as they do not have a way to implement the same technology (but we are happy to have them join Filecoin). 

Filecoin brings storage providers and data owners into the network with a variety of advantages and benefits. 

- Economies of scale
- Accessibility
- Data Locality
- Durability
- Cost

Being part of the Filecoin community gives you other benefits as well. 

- Preserve some of humanityâ€™s most important data
- Capitalize on the Web3 Wave of new datasets
- Actively participate and leverage the Open Network
- Receive incentives to bootstrap your business
- Take control back (regulations, margins, GDPR)
- Innovate and differentiate
- Earn passive income with your existing datasets.

### Creating passive income with your data

If you have your own datasets, you can put that data to work and earn passive income from Filecoin. If you stand up a storage provider and store just your own data, the network will reward you in the form of block rewards. You can reinvest these rewards or extract the rewards as profit. 

ROI example of storing your own data. 

**Investment**

$65K CAPEX

$1.5K x 18 OPEX 

$55K Fil loan (15% collateral)

Total ~$147K

**Return**

Store 500TiB Data = $267K 

Total Profit = ~$120K in 18 months. 

The calculation above shows a ROI of 18 months and a return of $120K for data that was already owned. 

### Protocol Labs Support

Protocol Labs and Filecoin Foundation are always looking at tooling to help storage providers. One of the places where we are focusing is the storage provider journey. What does it look like from learning what Filecoin is to running a full storage provider business. 

Learning opportunities are also getting off the ground. We recommend accelerator programs like ESPA, but we have self study methods available such as ProtoSchool. We are also building a storage provider landing page with all the latest updates and information related to running a storage provider business. 

We are also doing monthly AMAs with storage providers. This is where you can come and ask questions to other storage providers and lend to the discussion. 

Launchpad is a new program that Protocol Labs is hosting to train engineers and other new people within the Protocol Labs ecosystem. Its open to anyone who may need it, just apply and take it from there. 

### Where do we go from here

FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) will allow us to run smart contracts on Filecoin. This will increase the Filecoin use case, but it will also us to integrate with other compute stacks, encryption, CDN, bridges, and help create a decentralized datacenter.

### Conclusion

Protocol Labs is working together directly with storage providers, data owners, and developers to enhance the capabilities of the Filecoin network. We are open to working with anyone interested in contributing or joining the network as we work together to decentralize the datacenter.
