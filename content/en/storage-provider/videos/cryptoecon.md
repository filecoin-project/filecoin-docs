### What is CryptoEcon

In general terms, cryptoecon is a economic layer on top of a blockchain layer. This sentence, although easy to say hides the real nature of cryptoecon. Cryptoecon is a vast and complex interdisciplinary field with a range of topics covered.

CryptoEcon covers many different disciplines, combining them to understand the motivational factors that influence users of the Filecoin network.

### CryptoEcon for Filecoin

The Filecoin mission is to create a decentralized, robust and efficient foundation for humanityâ€™s data. Cryptoecon takes this statement and aligns network participants with the mission by rewarding storage, balancing interests in the long and short term stakeholders, and ensuring storage provision is profitable for reliable storage providers. 

Stakeholders could be any of the following. 

- Token Holders
- Storage Providers
- Clients (AKA Data Owners)
- Developers
- Ecosystem Partners

### Vision

What we expect in a long term version of Filecoin is one where clients propose deals, storage provider accepts deals, data is transferred to the storage provider, storage provider seals sectors, earns rewards, and eventually a retrieval market. The current state of the market is always in flux, but we are well on our way to realizing the future vision of Filecoin.

### State of the Network

As of the time of recording, the Filecoin network is up to 16 EiB in capacity with around a 10th of a percent in faults. A low fault rate rate shows that there is sufficient slack in the protocol to allow for flexibility and that the incentives are working. Storage capacity has increased almost 2 EiB in the past three months, showing a healthy growth rate. 

Gas usage (as of writing) has been stable. The amount of gas being burned is still high, but has been consistent. Commit sectors and pre-commit sectors are the largest contributors to gas fees. We feel that a gas model such as this is pretty good, but in the future with FVM that gas fees will go up as network usage goes up. 

### Design and Validation

The cryptoecon group is expanding rapidly. We started as just a few people and now we have a number of people onboarding. We function as a point of contact for crypto related code changes and examining how that would impact the economics of the system. We will review issues as we find them or as requested from Protocol Labs or other users. 

### Building the future

In economic terms, there are a lot of details but at the macro level what is driving progress is adoption. This completely relies on what is being built. FVM is a major project that can completely change what Filecoin can do. In brings interoperability and smart contracts to the network. The roadmap also includes generic off-chain compute. Scaling solutions are also coming to assist in keeping the gas costs low. 

Applications being built on top of these enhancements are hard to predict, but my personal view is we will see active governance, machine learning, optimal policy selection using machine learning, a world oracle (because we have a lot of data) and off chain compute enhancing all of those applications. The biggest things though will likely come out of FVM, things like dApps and Web3. Things like lending and insurance will come, but games will be big. When combined with smart contracts, we can really impact how the world does things in Web3. 

### Conclusion

We covered CryptoEcon, the state of the network, design and validation, and what is coming in the future. The economics behind Filecoin help ensure that the network will continue to impact the world in a positive way while keeping stakeholders happy. The world will change due to blockchain technology and with the help of Filecoin, we will change the way the world stores data.
