# Filecoin Documentation

**Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files on the internet, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time.**

Available storage and pricing is not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in.

The **Filecoin project documentation** homepage offers all the necessary resources to learn about Filecoin, the software and the tools to contribute to the network, either as a user looking for storage, or as a storage provider supplying storage capacity. Here are some links to get you started:
