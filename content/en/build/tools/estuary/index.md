[Estuary](https://estuary.tech) automates storage activities with Filecoin. At its core, Estuary is a simple IPFS node that integrates a minimal Filecoin client library. It is an open-source project built by [ARG](https://arg.protocol.ai/) and is available at [github.com/application-research/estuary](https://github.com/application-research/estuary).

Estuary is a great solution for developers and users who want a more accessible interface to store data on Filecoin. See the [Estuary documentation](https://docs.estuary.tech) to learn more about the project.

## Using Estuary

Estuary is still in the early stages, and as such, isn't quite ready for a public release. However, you can [request an invitation](https://docs.estuary.tech/get-invite-key) to test the project and start making Filecoin storage deals.
