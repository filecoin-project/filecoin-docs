Filecoin is for the builders. If you are excited about the potential of leveraging the Filecoin protocol and decentralized storage network to build game-changing applications, you've come to the right place.

There are several options to start integrating with Filecoin. Here are some guides to get you started:

- [Node Setup Tutorial]({{< relref "get-started.md" >}}), which gets you up and running quickly by creating a simple Node.js script using Infura and the Filecoin network.
- [Use Glif nodes](https://lotus.filecoin.io/docs/developers/hosted-lotus/) to skip spinning up a node and just start building.
- [Build with Lotus](https://lotus.filecoin.io), for users looking to interact with their own, local Lotus nodes.
- [Build with Powergate]({{< relref "powergate.md" >}}), for users wanting to combine IPFS (fast retrieval) and Filecoin (backup) with full control of both.
- [Build with Textile buckets]({{< relref "textile-buckets.md" >}}), for users looking for simple IPFS storage with Filecoin-based archival, with encryption and shared buckets support.

## Filecoin-backed storage providers

The following products provide storage solutions that are backed up by the Filecoin network and potentially [integrate IPFS as a hot-data layer (FPS)]({{< relref "filecoin-pinning-services.md" >}}).

{{< alert icon="tip" >}}
We plan to update this list regularly as new providers are announced and their features expand.

## Hosted nodes

Hosted node providers take care of running Filecoin node software for you so that you can focus on integrating and building on top of it.
