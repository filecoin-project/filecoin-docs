## Get started

Users can use the following software solutions to store data on the Filecoin network:

### Apps

The following applications allow you to store data on the Filecoin network with no technical setup:

- [ChainSafe Files](https://files.chainsafe.io/) provides decentralized cloud storage with end-to-end encryption in a Dropbox-like interface. Check out the [blog post by ChainSafe](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/introducing-chainsafe-files-3eedabdec922) for a quick overview of the service.
- [Estuary](https://estuary.tech) allows uploading and storing content on the Filecoin network directly from your browser, command line, and API.
- [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage) is an IPFS pinning service and Filecoin storage platform built-in-one. Upload files to Web3.Storage and access them instantly, safe in the knowledge that your data is securely backed up using the Filecoin network.
- [Slate](https://slate.host/) Slate is a search tool designed to help you remember and keep track of things you care about on the web.

### Filecoin Node Client

- [Lotus](https://lotus.filecoin.io) imports data and performs deals on the chain using its daemon and CLI. Lotus users get full control of the deals, the chosen providers, and the wallets used to pay. Make sure you are familiar with Lotus and have it installed and running.

### Digital Preservation

- [Starling]({{< relref "/basics/how-storage-works/storage-onramps" >}}) uses Lotus to simplify decentralized storage for digital _preservationists_ and archivists.

### Video

- [File.video](https://file.video/) provides decentralized video hosting using decentralized transcoding using the [LivePeer](https://livepeer.org/) network.

## Additional resources

There are additional storage solutions that you should not miss. While they have a focus on developers, some of them have simple CLI interfaces that simplify their usage:

- [Filebase](https://filebase.com) is a geo-redundant IPFS pinning service that offers automatic 3x replication for all IPFS files and an S3-compatible API for widespread versatility. Filebase will soon include Filcoin in its portfolio. 
- [Fleek](https://fleek.co) provides easy hosting and storage solutions on IPFS and their [SpaceDaemon](https://docs.fleek.co/space-daemon/overview/) and upcoming Space SDK use Filecoin.
- [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) is an IPFS pinning service that will soon include Filecoin in its portfolio.
- [Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate) a multi-tiered storage solution that stores data with IPFS and Filecoin.
- [Textile Buckets](https://docs.textile.io/buckets/) provide S3-like storage using IPFS with Filecoin-backed archival and has an easy-to-use CLI.
