Welcome to the Filecoin documentation for **Storage Providers**.

{{< alert icon="tip" >}}**Looking for Lotus?**
Lotus documentation has moved to [lotus.filecoin.io](https://lotus.filecoin.io)
{{< /alert >}}

Content in this section will help you to:

- Understand [how mining works](how-mining-works.md) and what different types of providers exist.
- Learn how storage providers get [rewards](mining-rewards.md) when doing their job properly, but also [slashed](slashing.md) when they are unable to honor deals they have made.
- Learn about different [mining architectures](mining-architectures.md).
- Setup and run a high performant [Lotus Miner](https://lotus.filecoin.io/docs/storage-providers/overview/).

The documentation you will be reading assumes you are familiar with the documentation in the [Get started](../get-started) section, have a general grasp of how Filecoin works and are familiar with Filecoin node software and tooling.

Running a successful storage provisioning operation on Filecoin has high [hardware requirements](hardware-requirements.md) and, apart from a strong familiarity with Filecoin, requires experience in systems deployment and administration.
