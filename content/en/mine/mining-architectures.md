This section provides examples for Filecoin Storage mining setups to guide miners to plan and make the right choices when acquiring and setting up their mining infrastructure. Any storage mining setup must meet the [minimal hardware requirements](hardware-requirements.md).

## Protocol Labs example architecture

The following [Lotus](https://lotus.filecoin.io) miner setup was published as part of the [Guide to Filecoin Storage Mining](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-guide-to-storage-mining/) blog post. A PDF is available for download [here](https://filecoin.io/vintage/mining-hardware-config-testnet-v3.pdf):
