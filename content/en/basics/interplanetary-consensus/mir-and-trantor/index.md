Beyond their function as a scaling tool, IPC subnets will be deployed to meet the requirements of applications that cannot be run on the Filecoin rootnet. The combination of Mir and Trantor provides a high-performance consensus mechanism with faster finality and higher throughput. Moreover, Trantor can be further configured for each subnet.

## Mir framework

[Mir](https://github.com/filecoin-project/mir) is a framework for implementing, debugging, and analyzing distributed protocols. It is organized as a library that provides abstractions representing different components of a distributed system, as well as an engine to orchestrate their interaction.

Mir aims to be general enough to enable implementing distributed protocols in a way that is agnostic to network transport, storage, and cryptographic primitive implementation. All these (and other) usual components of a distributed protocol implementation are encapsulated in abstractions with well-defined interfaces. While Mir provides some implementations of those abstractions to be used directly "out of the box", the consumer is free to provide their own implementations.

The first use of Mir is as a scalable and efficient consensus layer in Filecoin subnets. Learn more on [GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/mir).


## Trantor consensus protocol

Trantor is a modern multi-leader Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol, inspired by recently proposed high-throughput BFT consensus protocols, namely ISS and Narwahl. It iterates through instances of PBFT with immediate finality, each block containing an ordered list of decided transactions and a certificate for verification, with every âˆ†-th block containing a checkpoint of the state.
