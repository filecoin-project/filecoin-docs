## libp2p

A modular network stack, libp2p enables you to run your network applications free from runtime and address services, independently of their location. Learn more at [libp2p.io/](http://libp2p.io/).

## IPLD

IPLD is the data model of the content-addressable web. It allows us to treat all hash-linked data structures as subsets of a unified information space, unifying all data models that link data with hashes as instances of IPLD. Learn more at [ipld.io/](https://ipld.io/).

## IPFS

IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. However, it does not have support for incentivization or guarantees of this distributed storage; Filecoin provides the incentive layer. Learn more at [ipfs.tech/](https://ipfs.tech/).

## Multiformats

The Multiformats Project is a collection of protocols which aim to future-proof systems through self-describing format values that allow for interoperability and protocol agility. Learn more at [multiformats.io/](https://multiformats.io/).
