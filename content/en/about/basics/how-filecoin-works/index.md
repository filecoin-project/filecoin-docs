This page gives a basic introduction to how the Filecoin network operates. While the Filecoin network is similar to other cryptocurrency networks, there are some differences that developers looking to build on the network should be aware of.

## The Network

The Filecoin network is a distributed, peer-to-peer network formed by Filecoin peers who participate in different ways.

Peers communicate over secure channels they use to distribute information to the network, also known as _gossiping_. Peers use these secure channels to transfer data and discover other peers. This communication creates a well-connected swarm in which information like blocks and messages flow swiftly, even when many thousands of peers participate.

## Nodes

_Filecoin nodes_ are peers that sync the Filecoin blockchain and validate the messages in every block to provide a global state of the network.

Filecoin nodes can also broadcast different types of _messages_ to the network. For example, a client can publish a message to send FIL from one address to another. Nodes can propose [storage and retrieval deals](#deals) to storage providers and pay for them as the network executes them.

Running a Filecoin node is a low-level task that usually implies keeping a program running constantly. Several Filecoin node implementations are in the works, with [Lotus](https://lotus.filecoin.io) being the most advanced.

## Storage providers

Storage providers (SPs) deliver services to the network by executing different types of [deals](#deals). SPs also append new blocks to the chain every 30 seconds, for which they collect FIL rewards. Additional details about types of providers, rewards, and deals execution from the storage provider perspective can be found in the [How providing storage works]({{< relref "how-providing-storage-works" >}}) section.

Running a Filecoin storage provider is a highly-technical task with strong [hardware requirements]({{< relref "hardware-requirements" >}}) The [`lotus-miner` application](https://lotus.filecoin.io) is currently the most advanced implementation of a Filecoin storage provider.

## Deals

There are two main types of deals in Filecoin: _storage deals_ and _retrieval deals_.

### Storage deals

Storage deals are agreements between clients and _storage providers_ to store data on the network. Once a user initiates a deal, and the storage provider has received the data to store, it will repeatedly [prove](#proofs) that it is still storing the data so that it can collect [rewards]({{< relref "rewards.md" >}}). If the storage provider cannot prove that they are still storing the data correctly, they are [slashed]({{< relref "slashing" >}}) and lose FIL.

### Retrieval deals

Retrieval deals are agreements between clients and _retrieval providers_ to extract data stored on the network. Unlike storage deals, these deals are fulfilled off-chain using _payment channels_ to incrementally pay for the data received. Storage providers also often provide retrieval functions.

## Proofs

Storage providers must prove that they are storing the data following the terms of a storage deal. That means that:

- They must store all the data submitted by the client.
- They must store it during the whole lifetime of the deal.

Cryptographic proofs are used to these ends, as explained in this article about the [Filecoin proof system](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-proof-system/).

Using _Proof Of Replication (PoRep)_, storage providers demonstrate that they have received all the data and encoded it in a way unique to that storage provider. Using their physical storage in a way that no other storage provider is important since two deals for the same data cannot end up re-using the same disk. This proof is provided when the deal starts and the _sealing_ operation completes.

Once a deal is active, the storage provider will use _Proof of Spacetime (PoSt)_ to prove that it is still storing the data associated with a deal. For PoSt, random storage providers need to prove that random parts of the data they store are still there.

Filecoin clients and other storage providers continuously verify that the proofs included in each block are valid. This process delivers security and stability to the network by penalizing storage providers that do not honor their deals.

## Gas fees

Executing messages consumes both computation and storage resources on the network. _Gas_ is a measure of resources consumed by each message. The gas consumed by a message directly affects the cost the sender must pay for it to be included in a new block.

Historically in other blockchains, miners specify a _gas fee_ in a unit of native currency and then pay the block-producing miners a priority fee based on how much gas is consumed by the message. Filecoin works similarly, except an amount of the fees is burned (sent to an irrecoverable address) to compensate for the network expenditure of resources since all nodes need to validate the messages. The idea is based on Ethereum's [EIP1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).

A dynamic `BaseFee` value determines the amount of fees burned in the Filecoin network. The `BaseFee` is automatically adjusted according to the network congestion parameters, also known as _block sizes_. Users can obtain the current value from one of the [block explorers]({{< relref "explore-the-network" >}}) or by inspecting the current head of the chain.

Additionally, several gas-related parameters are attached to each message and determine the reward storage providers get. Here's an overview of the terms and concepts:

### Gas usage

The amount of gas that a message's execution consumes. Nodes do not know how much gas a message will exactly consume ahead of execution, but it can be estimated. `GasUsage` is measured in units of _Gas_.

### Base fee

The amount of FIL that gets burned per unit of gas consumed for the execution of every message. It is measured in units of `attoFIL ÷ Gas`.

### Gas limit

A limit on the amount of gas a message's execution can consume. This limit is estimated and specified by the message sender. It is measured in units of `Gas`. The sum of _GasLimit_ for all messages included in a block must not exceed the _BlockGasLimit_. Messages will fail to execute if they run out of _Gas_, and the network will revert any effects of the execution.

### Gas fee cap

The maximum token amount a sender is willing to pay per `GasUnit` for including a message in a block. It is measured in units of `attoFIL / Gas`. A message sender must have a minimum balance of `GasFeeCap × GasLimit` when sending a message, even though not all of that will be consumed. _GasFeeCap_ can safeguard against high, unexpected _BaseFee_ fluctuations.

### Gas premium

A priority fee that is paid to the block-producing storage provider. This is capped by _GasFeeCap_. The _BaseFee_ has a higher priority. It is measured in units of `attoFIL ÷ Gas` and can be as low as 1 `attoFIL ÷ Gas`.

### Overestimation burn

An additional amount of gas to burn that grows larger when the difference between `GasLimit` and `GasUsage` is large.

### Total cost

The total cost of a message for a sender will be:

```plaintext
(GasUsage × BaseFee FIL) + (GasLimit × GasPremium FIL) + (OverEstimationBurn × BaseFee FIL) = Total Cost
```

A message will **always pay the burn fee** regardless of the _GasFeeCap_ used. Thus, a low _GasFeeCap_ may result in a reduced _GasPremium_ or even a negative one! In that case, the storage providers that include a message will have to pay the needed amounts out of their own pockets, which means they are unlikely to include such messages in new blocks.

Filecoin implementations may choose the heuristics of how their storage providers select messages for inclusion in new blocks, but they will usually attempt to maximize the storage provider's rewards.

## Actors

Actors are a [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for managing state. Accounts, multisigs, storage providers, and account balances all have states, and are implemented as an _actor_.

Actors are the Filecoin equivalent of smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem. As such, actors are very central components of the system. Any change to the current state of the Filecoin blockchain has to be triggered through an actor.

## Addresses

In Filecoin, addresses are used to identify actors. There are four address types:

| Address prefix | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | An ID address. |
| `1` | A [SECP256K1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) public key address. |
| `2` | An actor address |
| `3` | A [BLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) public key address. |

### ID addresses

All actors have a short integer assigned to them by `InitActor`, a unique actor that can create _new_ actors. This integer that gets assigned is the ID of that actor. An _ID address_ is an actor's ID prefixed with the network identifier and the address type.

Here's the structure for the mainnet burn account ID address `f099`:

```plaintext
  Address type
  |
f 0 9 9
|    |
|    Actor ID
|
Network identifier
```

ID addresses are often referred to by their shorthand `f0`.

### Public key addresses

Actors managed directly by users, like accounts, are derived from a public-private key pair. If you have access to a private key, you can sign messages sent from that actor. The public key is used to derive an address for the actor.

Public key addresses allow devices, like hardware wallets, to derive a valid Filecoin address for your account using just the public key. The device doesn't need to ask a remote node what your ID address is.

Filecoin supports both [`secp256k1` addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) that begin with `f1`, and [BLS addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) that begin with `f3`.

Public key addresses are often referred to by their shorthand `f1` or `f3`.

### Robust addresses and ID addresses

Public key addresses are referred to as _robust addresses_ as they do not depend on the Filecoin chain state.

Actor IDs are not _robust_ and are defined on-chain by the `InitActor`. An actor ID can change for a brief time after its creation if the same ID is assigned to different actors on different forks. You can think of ID addresses as a monotonically increasing numeric primary key in a relational database. When a chain reorg occurs or a rollback in SQL terms, you can refer to the same ID for different rows. The [expected consensus](https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-algorithms.expected_consensus) algorithm will resolve the conflict. Once the state that defines a new ID reaches finality, no changes can occur; the ID is bound to that actor forever.

Robust addresses provide a safe way to reference actors before the chain state is final. ID addresses are used as a space-efficient way to identify actors in the Filecoin chain state, where every byte matters, and in a human-friendly, concise form.

### Actor addresses

<!-- TODO: what is the account creation referenced here? Is there an example of generating this actor address within a terminal window? -->
Actor addresses provide a way to create robust addresses for actors not associated with a public key. They are generated by taking a `sha256` hash of the output of the account creation. The ZH storage provider has the actor address `f2plku564ddywnmb5b2ky7dhk4mb6uacsxuuev3pi` and the ID address `f01248`.

Actor addresses are often referred to by their shorthand `f2`.
<!-- END-TODO -->

<!-- TODO: decide if this section is necessary. It's pretty in-depth regarding key creation. Is this ever mentioned in the specs? If yes, I suggest we remove this section. -->
### BLS public key addresses

In addition to secp256k1 `f1` addresses, BLS addresses in Filecoin begin with `f3`. Filecoin uses curve bls12-381 for BLS signatures. Bls12-381 is a pair of two related curves: G1 and G2. Implementations of bls12-381 can vary based on if public keys are on G1 and signatures on G2 or vice-versa.

Filecoin uses G1 for public keys and G2 for signatures, as G1 allows for a smaller representation of public keys. This is the same design decision made with ETH2, but contrasts with, for instance, Zcash, which has signatures on G1 and public keys on G2.

Also, note that Filecoin stores and interprets private keys in little-endian order. This contrasts ETH2 keys, which also use bls12-381 but are stored in big-endian order.

BLS public key addresses are often referred to by their shorthand `f3`.
