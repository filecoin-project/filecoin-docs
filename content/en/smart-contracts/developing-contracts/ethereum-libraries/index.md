## OpenZeppelin

[OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) provides a library of battle-tested smart contract templates, including widely used implementations of ERC token standards. For a guided example that implements an ERC20 token on the Filecoin network, see [Example using an ERC20 contract](#example-using-an-erc20-contract).

### Benefits 

OpenZeppelin offers the following to smart contract developers:

- Implementations of standards like ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155.
- Flexible access control schemes like `Ownable`, `AccessControl`, and `onlyRole`.
- Useful and secure utilities for signature verification, `SafeMath`, etc..

Token standards, such as [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20), are the most widely used smart contract libraries from OpenZepplin. These contracts, listed below, implement both _fungible_ and _non-fungible_ tokens:

- [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) is the simplest and most widespread token standard for fungible assets. 
- [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721) is the de-facto solution for non-fungible tokens and is often used for collectibles and games.
- [ERC777](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc777) provides a richer standard for fungible tokens, supporting new use cases and backwards compatibility with ERC20.
- [ERC1155](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc1155) is a new standard for _multi-tokens_, where a single contract represents multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens, and operations are batched for increased gas efficiency.

### Using OpenZeppelin with FVM

The _general_ procedure for using OpenZeppelin with FVM is as follows:

1. Install OpenZeppelin. For example, using `npm`:

   ```bash
   npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

1. Import the specific library you want to use.
1. In your smart contract, inherit the library.

Thanks to the FVM, your contract can be integrated and deployed on the Filecoin network with OpenZepplin inheritance. For a guided example that implements an ERC20 token on the Filecoin network, see [Example using an ERC20 contract](#example-using-an-erc20-contract).

### Example using an ERC20 contract

In the following tutorial, you'll write and deploy a smart contract that implements the [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) on the Calibration testnet using Remix and MetaMask:

#### Prerequisites

Let's take an ERC20 contract as an example to write and deploy it on the Calibration testnet using Remix & MetaMask:

- Remix.
- MetaMask.
- [MetaMask connected to the Calibration testnet]({{< relref "/basics/assets/metamask-setup" >}}).
- Test tokens (tFIL) [from the faucet](https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/funds.html).

#### Procedure

In this procedure, you will create, deploy, mint and send an [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) token on Calibration using Remix and MetaMask. 

1. Navigate to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
1. Next to **Workspaces**, click the **+** icon to create a new workspace.
1. In the **Choose a template** dropdown, select **ERC 20** along with the **Mintable** checkbox.

   ![Set workspace details.](create-a-workspace-details.png)

1. Click **OK**.
1. In the **contract** directory, open **MyToken.sol**.
1. Set the token `<name>` and `<symbol>`:

   ```solidity
   // contracts/GLDToken.sol
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

   contract MyToken is ERC20 {
      constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20(<name>, <symbol>) {
         _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
      }
   }
   ```

   Next, compile and deploy the contract on Filecoin.

1. At the top of the workspace, click the green play symbol to compile the contract.

   ![Compile the contract.](compile-compile.png)

1. Once the contract compiles, open the **Deploy** tab on the left.
1. Under the **Environment** dropdown, select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**. 
1. In the MetaMask popup window, select **Confirmed connection**.

   ![Select contract in Remix.](deploy-select-contract.png)

1. Click **Deploy**, and confirm the transaction on MetaMask. Your token contract will be deployed to the Calibration testnet once the network confirms the transaction.
1. In Remix, open the **Deployed Contracts** dropdown. 
1. In the `mint` method, set:
   -  `to` to your wallet address.
   -  `amount` to `100000000000000000000` (1 `FIL`).

   ![Click Deploy in Remix.](deploy-remix-deploy.png)

1. Click **Transact**.
1. In MetaMask, confirm the transaction. 

Once the network processes the transaction, the token is minted and sent to your network address. Congratulations, you've completed the tutorial!
