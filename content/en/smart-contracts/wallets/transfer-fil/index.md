The process by which you transfer FIL will vary depending on whether you are sending from [an Eth-style (`0x`) account](#ethereum-style-account) or [a Filecoin-style (`f1`, `f2`, `f3`) account](#filecoin-style-account).

## Ethereum-style account

The exact process to send FIL from a Filecoin Ethereum-style (`0x`) account on the Filecoin network depends on the destination. If your destination is:

- **Another Ethereum-style (`0x`) address**, you have two options:

  - Simply open your Ethereum wallet and use its transfer function. It doesnâ€™t matter if the destination is an account or a smart contract. You can follow the [standard MetaMask instructions](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-send-tokens-from-your-MetaMask-wallet).
  - Use one of the [supported exchanges](#exchanges-that-support-0x).

- **A Filecoin-style (`f1`, `f2`, `f3`) address**, check out the [FilFowarder]({{< relref "/smart-contracts/wallets/filforwader" >}}) article we put together.

## Filecoin-style account

The exact process to send FIL from a Filecoin-style (`f1`, `f2`, `f3`)  account on the Filecoin network depends on the destination. If your destination is:

- **Another Filecoin-style (`f1`, `f2`, `f3`) address**, use a Filecoin wallet, such as [Glif](https://glif.io) or [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live). Just enter the f-style address and make the transfer as per the wallet instructions.

- **An Ethereum-style (`0x`) address**, you can:
  - Use one of the methods described in [Transfer Fil to a 0x address]({{< relref "fil-to-zero-x" >}}) based on your specific situation.
  - Use one of the [supported exchanges](#exchanges-that-support-0x).

## Exchanges that support 0x

If you are funding a Filecoin Ethereum-style (`0x`) account from an exchange, you must use one that supports this account type account. The following exchanges support withdrawing directly to Filecoin Ethereum-style addresses:

Any exchange that trades Filecoin, but is not listed below, can only send FIL directly to an `f3` address.
