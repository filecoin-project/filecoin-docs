lead: "Spacenet is a Filecoin testnet modified to support Interplanetary Consensus (IPC). It aims to provide developers with a testbed to deploy their FVM use cases and innovate with new Web3 applications that leverage IPC subnets and the high-performance consensus provided by the Mir framework and the Trantor BFT consensus protocol. However, it is an experimental network, and users should expect unplanned downtime, complete restarts, and frequent bugs."

**Maintainer**: [ConsensusLab](https://consensuslab.world)

Spacenet is not _just_ another Filecoin testnet. It has been modified to run the high-performance [Trantor BFT consensus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/mir/tree/main/pkg/systems/trantor), implemented atop [Mir](https://github.com/filecoin-project/mir), a framework for implementing distributed protocols. And did we forget to mention Spacenet comes with built-in [Interplanetary Consensus (IPC)]({{< relref "basics/interplanetary-consensus/overview" >}}) support?

Spacenet aims to provide developers with a testbed to deploy decentralized applications that can benefit from IPC's capabilities, particularly the ability to deploy and transact in subnets.

To learn more about what you can do on Spacenet, visit the [Interplanetary Consensus]({{< relref "basics/interplanetary-consensus/overview" >}}) section. For instructions on working with Spacenet, visit the [Spacenet repository](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/spacenet).
