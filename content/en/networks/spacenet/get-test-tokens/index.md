A faucet is available at [faucet.spacenet.ipc.space](https://faucet.spacenet.ipc.space) for developers to get test Filecoin (tFIL) on the Spacenet testnet. The faucet has the following restrictions:

- The per-request allowance given by the faucet is of 10 tFIL.
- There is a daily maximum of 20 tFIL per address.
- And we have also limited the maximum amount of funds that the faucet can withdraw daily.
