A faucet is available at [spacenet.consensus.ninja](https://spacenet.consensus.ninja) for developers to get test Filecoin (tFIL) on the Spacenet testnet. The faucet has the following restrictions:

- The per-request allowance given by the faucet is of 10 tFIL.
- There is a daily maximum of 20 tFIL per address.
- And we have also limited the maximum amount of funds that the faucet can withdraw daily.
