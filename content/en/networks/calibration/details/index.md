The Calibration testnet is the most realistic simulation of the Filecoin mainnet.

Prospective storage providers can experience more realistic sealing performance and hardware requirements using final proofs constructions and parameters. Storage clients can store and retrieve _real data_ on the network. Clients can also participate in deal-making workflows and storage and retrieval functionality. The sector size on the Calibration testnet is the same as on the Filecoin mainnet; 32 GiB and 64 GiB sectors are supported. This testnet also includes the Filecoin EVM-runtime features found on the Filecoin mainnet.

**Large sector sizes**

A drawback of 32 GiB and 64 GiB sectors is that storage providers generally prefer deals that use a significant amount of the sector. This could cause issues for builders wanting to store less than 4 GiB of data. Check out the [Active storage providers section](#active-storage-providers) for details on SPs you can connect to.

Developers can reference pre-existing deals that are already available on the network. See the [`#fil-net-calibration-discuss` channel in the Filecoin Slack](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C01D42NNLMS) for support.

## Active storage providers

The following storage providers are running on the Calibration testnet.

### [PiKNiK](https://github.com/benjaminh83/fvm-calib-deal-miners)

* **t017840**: Every deal accepted by this SP will be aggregated into 32 GiB sectors, which is the minimum size for calibration network. This miner has a preset sealing capacity of 2x 32 GiB sectors per day, defined as sectors in waitdeals will be flushed every 12 hours.
