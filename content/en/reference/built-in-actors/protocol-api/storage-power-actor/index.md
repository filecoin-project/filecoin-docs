The ActorCode for the built-in storage power actor is `hex"0004"` which will be used to call methods in the storage power actor. You also need to specify the method number for the method you want to invoke. Please refer to each method for its method number.

## CreateMiner

```go
func CreateMiner(params CreateMinerParams) CreateMinerReturn {}
```

Create a new miner for the owner address and worker address.

`uint` CreateMinerMethodNum = 1173380165.

Params:

- `struct` CreateMinerParams
  - `bytes` Owner - the address of the owner.
  - `bytes` Worker - the address of the worker.
  - `RegisteredPoStProof` WindowPoStProofType - the type of RegisteredPoStProof.
  - `bytes` Peer - peerID.
  - `bytes[]` Multiaddrs - the multi-address which is used to control the newly created miner.

Results:

- CreateMinerReturn

  - `bytes` IDAddress - The canonical ID-based address for the actor.

  - `byte`: RobustAddress -A more expensive but re-org-safe address for the newly created actor.

## NetworkRawPower

```go
func NetworkRawPower() NetworkRawPowerReturn {}
```

Return the total raw power of the network.

`uint`  NetworkRawPowerMethodNum = 931722534.

Params:

- null

Results:

- `int256`  NetworkRawPowerReturn - the raw storage power of the whole network.

## MinerRawPower

```go
func MinerRawPower(params MinerRawPowerParams) MinerRawPowerParams {}
```

Return the raw power claimed by the specified miner and whether the miner has more than the minimum amount of active storage.

`uint` MinerRawPowerMethodNum = 3753401894.

Params:

- MinerRawPowerParams
  - `uint64` Miner - Miner ID

Results:

- `struct` MinerRawPowerParams
- `int256` RawBytePower - the row power of the miner.
  
- `bool` MeetsConsensusMinimum - if the miner power meets the minimum for consensus.

## MinerCount

```go
func MinerCount() MinerCountReturn {}
```

Returns the total number of miners created, regardless of whether or not they have any pledged storage.

`uint` MinerRawPowerMethodNum = 3753401894.

Params:

- null

Results:

- `uint64` MinerCountReturn - the count of the miners that the caller address has.

## MinerConsensusCount

```go
func MinerConsensusCount() MinerConsensusCountReturn {}
```

Returns the total number of miners that have more than the minimum amount of active storage.

`uint`  MinerConsensusCountMethodNum = 196739875.

Params:

- null

Results:

- `uint64`MinerConsensusCountReturn - the count of the miners that meet the consensus minimum that the caller address has.
