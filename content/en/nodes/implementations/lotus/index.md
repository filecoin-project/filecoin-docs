## Interact with Lotus

There are many ways to interact with a Lotus node, depending on your specific needs and interests. By leveraging the powerful tools and APIs provided by Lotus, you can build custom applications, extend the functionality of the network, and contribute to the ongoing development of the Filecoin ecosystem.

### Lotus API

Lotus provides a comprehensive API that allows developers to interact with the Filecoin network programmatically. The API includes methods for performing various operations such as storing and retrieving data, mining blocks, and transferring FIL tokens. You can use the API to build custom applications or integrate Filecoin functionality into your existing applications.

### Lotus CLI

Lotus includes a powerful command-line interface that allows developers to interact with the Filecoin network from the terminal. You can use the CLI to perform various operations such as creating wallets, sending FIL transactions, and querying the network. The CLI is a quick and easy way to interact with the network and is particularly useful for testing and development purposes.

### Custom plugin

Lotus is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to create custom plugins that add new functionality to the network. You can develop plugins that provide custom storage or retrieval mechanisms, implement new consensus algorithms, or add support for new network protocols.

### Source contributions

If you are interested in contributing to the development of Lotus itself, you can do so by contributing to the open-source codebase on GitHub. You can submit bug reports, suggest new features, or submit code changes to improve the functionality, security, or performance of the network.

## Hosted nodes

Many hosting service provide access to Lotus nodes on the Filecoin network. Check out the [RPC section for more information]({{< relref "/networks/mainnet/rpcs" >}})
