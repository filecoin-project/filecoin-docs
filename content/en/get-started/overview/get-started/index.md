Working with blockchains is difficult, and the inherent complexity of blockchains can be overwhelming for new developers. If you're not sure where to begin, we recommend you take a look at these sections before diving into more complex parts of Filecoin:

## Wallets

Filecoin wallets allow you to manage FIL, Filecoin's native token. Wallets store the private keys that allow you to authorize Filecoin transactions, including paying for storage deals and sending FIL to other accounts. See the [About Wallet Addresses](https://lotus.filecoin.io/docs/set-up/manage-fil) to learn about the kinds of addresses used by Filecoin accounts.

The table below lists the recommended wallet implementations:

| Name                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [Glif Wallet](https://wallet.glif.io/) | Glif Wallet is a lightweight web interface to send and receive Filecoin with a Ledger device ([instructions](https://reading.supply/@glif/install-the-filecoin-app-on-your-ledger-device-y33vhX)).|
| [Glif Safe](https://safe.glif.io/) | Glif Safe is a multisig wallet with a lightweight web interface to send and receive Filecoin with a Ledger device ([instructions](https://reading.supply/@glif/install-the-filecoin-app-on-your-ledger-device-y33vhX)). Check out the [Glif Safe GitHub repo](https://github.com/glifio/safe) for more information.|
| [Lotus](https://lotus.filecoin.io)                         | Lotus includes a command-line wallet that can manage bls, sec1p256k1, multisig wallets, and supports [Ledger integration](https://lotus.filecoin.io/docs/set-up/manage-fil/#ledger).|

Glif Safe and Lotus both support multisig wallets, a multisig wallet is a wallet that requires two or more private keys in order to sign and send transactions. Multisig wallets prevent any one private key holder from signing and sending a transaction, this is beneficial for wallets with multiple users and for people who are concerned about an attack on their wallet.

Lotus, Glif Safe, and Glif Wallet all support [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware devices, allowing you to use Filecoin without storing your private keys on a network-connected device. This can help protect your valuable private keys from malicious software on your computer and is commonly used for accounts with large balances.

There are a number of [additional wallets](https://docs.filecoin.io/reference/#other-wallets) that support Filecoin tokens, including mobile wallets.

## Filecoin implementations

There are 4 Filecoin protocol implementations (or "node software") currently in progress:

- [lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/) (Go): This implementation is closest to feature-complete and is, therefore, the recommended Filecoin protocol implementation.
- [venus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus) (Go): This implementation is currently running tens of nodes on the Filecoin network. Participants are encouraged to experiment with this implementation and provide feedback to the [Venus team](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/CEHHJNJS3).
- [forest](https://github.com/chainsafe/forest) (Rust)
- [fuhon](https://github.com/filecoin-project/cpp-filecoin) (C++)

Each of these software clients implements the Filecoin protocol as described in the [Filecoin protocol specification](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs). To learn more about why there are multiple Filecoin implementations, please read [this blog post](https://filecoin.io/blog/announcing-filecoin-implementations-in-rust-and-c++/).

Here is a snapshot of each implementation's progress across the primary parts of the Filecoin protocol (updated August 1, 2022):

| 8. Market          | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ    | ‚õîÔ∏è     | ‚õîÔ∏è    |

‚úÖ : fully-featured implementation.
üîÑ : reuses components from another implementation.
üî∂ : partial implementation.
‚õîÔ∏è : pending implementation.

Since May 2022, Fuhon's C++ implementation has been deprecated and is currently out of support. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/cpp-filecoin). There are no immediate plans to introduce another c++ implementation.
