title: "Chain indexers"
description: "A chain indexer is a type of indexer that is used to index the blocks in a blockchain. This allows for faster and more efficient querying of the blockchain, as the indexer maintains an index of the blocks in the chain, making it easy to look up specific blocks or transactions. Chain indexers are often used in conjunction with blockchain explorers, which provide a user-friendly interface for viewing and interacting with the blockchain."
