## Slack

Like many other distributed teams, the FVM team works mostly on Slack. You can join the Filecoin Project Slack for free by going to [filecoin.io/slack](https://filecoin.io/slack/). The FVM team hangs out in the following channels:

- [`#fil-builders`](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/CRK2LKYHW) for building solutions on FVM and Filecoin
- [`#fil-fvm-dev`](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C029MT4PQB1) for development of the FVM
- [`#fvm-docs`](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03MDFERKMJ) for FVM documentation
- [`#fil-net-hyperspace-discuss`](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C04JEJB82RY) for the FVM test network (recommended for builders)

## Forum

If you just need a general pointer, you can head over to the [FVM forum](https://fvm-forum.filecoin.io).

## Developer grants

The [Filecoin Grant Platform](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants) connects grantmakers with builders and researchers in the Filecoin community. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, or a dev team itching to hack on the FVM, [take a look at the supported grant types and available opportunities â†’](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants)
