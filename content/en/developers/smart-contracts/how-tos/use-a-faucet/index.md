## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you must have an address on the Hyperspace testnet. Follow the [Add to MetaMask guide]({{< relref "add-to-metamask" >}}) if you don't have one yet.

## Hyperspace testnet

1. Open your browser and open MetaMask.
1. Click your account to copy the address to your clipboard:
1. Go to [hyperspace.yoga](https://hyperspace.yoga/#faucet) and scrolldown to the **Faucet** section.
1. Paste your address into the address field, complete the **I am human** captcha, and then click **Send**:
1. The faucet should give you a link to the transaction. Click it to view your transaction:
1. The block explorer will show you the transaction history for your address. After a couple of minutes, you should see 5000 `tFIL` transferred to your address.
1. Open MetaMask to confirm that you received the `tFIL`:
1. Done!
