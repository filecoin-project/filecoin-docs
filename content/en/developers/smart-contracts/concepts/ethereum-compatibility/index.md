{{< beta-warning >}}

Take a look at this short presentation by [@truckerfling]('https://twitter.com/truckerfling') on Ethereum compatibility of FVM:

{{< youtube "lgUMVhM3FIM" >}}

<!-- - What does EVM compatibility mean -->
<!-- - Can I use my EVM contracts? -->
<!-- - Why FEVM? Why not just EVM? -->
<!-- - Ethereum JSON-RPC on FVM (reconciling with tipsets) -->
<!-- - Can I deploy an existing Solidity smart contract to FEVM? -->
<!-- - What's the speed of FVM compared to EVM -->
<!-- - Can I use precompiles on FEVM? -->
