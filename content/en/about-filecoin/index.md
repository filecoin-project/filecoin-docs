# Introduction

Filecoin’s mission is to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity’s information. To advance that mission, we’ve created a decentralized storage network that lets anyone in the world store or retrieve files. We hope Filecoin will make storage cheaper and more reliable by helping small players compete directly with well-known centralized services, providing a common interface for providers of all sizes, and greatly reducing migration and transaction costs.
