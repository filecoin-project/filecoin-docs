So you want to contribute to Filecoin and the ecosystem? Here is a quick listing of things we need help with and how you can get started. Even if what you want to do is not listed here, we probably accept contributions for it! If you're unsure, please open a issue.

### Code

Filecoin and its sister-projects are big, with lots of code written in multiple languages. We always need help writing and maintaining code, but it can be daunting to just jump in. We use the label _Help Wanted_ on features or bugfixes that people can help out with. They are an excellent place for you to start contributing code.

The biggest and most active repositories we have today are:

- [filecoin-project/venus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus)
- [filecoin-project/lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus)
- [filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs)

If you want to start contributing to the core of Filecoin, those repositories are a great place start. But the _Help Wanted_ label exists in several related projects:

- [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs)
- [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p)
- [IPLD](https://github.com/libp2p)
- [Multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats)

### Documentation

Filecoin is a huge project and undertaking, and with lots of code comes the need for lots of good documentation! However, we need a lot more help to write the awesome docs the project needs. If writing technical documentation is your area, weâ€™d absolutely love your help!

Before contributing to the Filecoin docs, please read these quick guides; they'll save you time and help keep the docs accurate and consistent!

1. [Style and formatting guide]({{< relref "./grammar-formatting-and-style.md" >}})
2. [Writing guide]({{< relref "./writing-guide.md" >}})

If you have never contributed to an open-source project before, or just need a refresher, take a look at the [contribution tutorial]({{< relref "./contribution-tutorial.md" >}}).

### Community

If interacting with people is your favorite thing to do in this world, join the [Filecoin chat and discussion forums]({{< relref "chat-and-discussion-forums" >}}) to say hello, meet others who share your goals, and connect with other members of the community.

### Build Applications

Filecoin is designed for you to integrate into your own applications and services.

Get started by looking at the list of projects currently built on Filecoin. Build anything you think is missing! If you're unsure about something, you can join the chat and discussion forums to get help or feedback on your specific problem/idea. You can also apply for a Filecoin Developer Grant to support the development of your project.

### Protocol Design

Filecoin is ultimately about building better protocols, and we always welcome ideas and feedback on how to improve those protocols.

### Research

Finally, we see Protocol Labs as a research lab, where YOUR ideas can become technologies that have a real impact on the world. If you're interested in contributing to our research, please reach out to [research@protocol.ai](mailto:research@protocol.ai) for more information. Include what your interests are so we can make sure you get to work on something fun and valuable.
