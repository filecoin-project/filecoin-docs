The Filecoin community is active and here to answer your questions in your channel of choice.

## Chat

For shorter-lived discussions, our community chat open to all on Slack:

- [Slack](https://filecoin.io/slack/)

## Discussion Forums

For long-lived discussions and for support, please use the [discussion tab on GitHub](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community#forums) instead of Slack or Matrix. Itâ€™s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on those chat platforms, and posting longer discussions and support requests on the forums helps future visitors, too.
