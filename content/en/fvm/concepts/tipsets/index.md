The Filecoin network produces multiple blocks at every epoch. In simple terms, block producers run a local function that uses their _quality-adjusted power_, as represented in the power table, and randomness from the Drand network to determine if they're eligible to produce a block for the current epoch. This consensus protocol is called _expected consensus_.

These blocks are assembled in a **tipset**, and the execution of their messages is deferred to the next tipset. Theoretically, there can be `0` to infinite blocks in a tipset. In practice, however, we see `5` to `10` blocks per tipset.

Wherever you see the term _block_ in the Ethereum JSON-RPC, you should mentally read _tipset_. Before FEVM and the Filecoin Ethereum JSON-RPC, there was no single hash referring to a tipset. A tipset ID was the concatenation of block CIDs, which led to a variable length ID, and a pretty poor experience.

With the Ethereum JSON-RPC, we introduced the concept of the tipset CID for the first time! It is calculated by hashing the former _tipset key_ using a blake-256 hash. Therefore:

- Wherever you see _block hash_, think _tipset hash_.
- Wherever you see _block height_, think _tipset epoch_.
- Wherever you see _block messages_, think _messages in all blocks in a tipset, in their order of appearance, deduplicated and returned in canonical order of execution_.
