## Hardhat

We're going to use the [FEVM Hardhat Kit repository](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FEVM-Hardhat-Kit) in the Filecoin Project GitHub organization to get started quickly.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

You should also have an address on the Filecoin Wallaby testnet. See the [Add to MetaMask page]({{< relref "add-to-metamask" >}}) for information on how to get an address. You also need test-FIL `tFIL` in your wallet. See the [Use a Faucet]({{< relref "use-a-faucet" >}}) page for information on how to get test funds.

### Steps

1. Clone the `filecoin-project/FEVM-Hardhat-Kit` repository and move into the `FEVM-Hardhat-Kit` directory:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/FEVM-Hardhat-Kit.git
    cd FEVM-Hardhat-Kit
    ```

1. Install the project dependencies with Yarn:

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

1. Export your private key from MetaMask. See the [MetaMask documentation](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key) to find out how to export your private key.
1. In your terminal, create an environment variable called `PRIVATE_KEY` and paste in the private key from MetaMask:

    ```shell
    export PRIVATE_KEY='eed8e9d727a647f7302bab440d405ea87d36726e7d9f233ab3ff88036cfbce9c'
    ```

1. Inside the `contracts` folder in a contract called `SimpleCoin.sol`. Deploy this contract using Hardhat:

    ```shell
    yarn hardhat deploy
    ```

    ```plaintext
    ...

    âœ¨  Done in 79.61s. 
    ```

    The deployment process should take a couple of minutes. Once the contract has been successfully deployed, Hardhat will give you a contract address you can use to interact with the contract.

1. You can now interact with your contract using the contract address given by Hardhat.
1. Done!
