**THIS SECTION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

The FVM project is still in beta, as is this documentation. We're working on improving everything. In the meantime, you can dive into the docs, but keep in mind that things will likely change pretty often.
{{< /alert >}}

- A quick refresher of the FVM, for folks who haven't read the introduction.
- How to create a Hello world-like contract in Remix.
- Compile and deploy that contract onto the FVM testnet.
- Call the contract using Metamask, or something like that.
