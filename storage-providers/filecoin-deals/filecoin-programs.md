# Filecoin programs and tools

Although it is possible to find your own data storage customers with valuable datasets they want to store, and have them verified through KYC ([Know Your Customer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know\_your\_customer)) to create verified deals for [Filecoin Plus](../../basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus.md), there are also programs and platforms that make it easier for storage providers to receive verified deals.

## [Web3.storage](https://web3.storage/)

## Former programs and tools

Here is a comprehensive list of deprecated tools and projects.

### Evergreen

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintenance-deprecated_04/2024-red.svg?style=for-the-badge)

Evergreen extended the [Slingshot](#slingshot) program by aiming to store open datasets forever. Standard deals had a maximum duration of 540 days, which was not long enough for valuable, open datasets that might need to be stored forever. Evergreen used the [Spade](#spade) deal engine, which automatically renewed deals to extend the lifetime of the dataset on-chain.

### CO2.Storage

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintenance-deprecated_04/2024-red.svg?style=for-the-badge)

CO2.Storage was a decentralized storage solution for structured data based on content-addressed data schemas. CO2.Storage primarily focused on structured data for environmental assets, such as Renewable Energy Credits, Carbon Offsets, and geospatial datasets, and mapped inputs to base data schemas (IPLD DAGs) for off-chain data (like metadata, images, attestation documents, and other assets) to promote the development of standard data schemas for environmental assets. This project was in alpha, and while many features could be considered stable, it was waiting until being feature complete to fully launch. The Filecoin Green team was actively working on this project and welcomed contributions from the community.

### Filecoin Tracker

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintenance-deprecated_04/2024-red.svg?style=for-the-badge)

Filecoin Tracker was deprecated on April 20, 2024.

Here are great existing and working Filecoin dashboards that cover similar topics:

- [Starboard](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/dashboard)
- [Filecoin Dune Daily Metrics](https://dune.com/kalen/filecoin-daily-metrics)
- [Filecoin Pulse (PoC)](https://filecoinpulse.pages.dev/)

### Slingshot

Slingshot was a program that united Data clients, Data preparers and storage providers in a community to onboard data and share replicas of publicly valuable [_Open Datasets_](https://datasets.filecoin.io). Rather than providing a web interface like Estuary, Slingshot was a program that provides a workflow and tools for onboarding of large open datasets. The Slingshot Deal Engine provided deals to registered and certified storage providers. The data was prepared and uploaded using a tool called [Singularity](#singularity).

### Dataprograms.org

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintenance-deprecated_04%2F2024-red.svg?style=for-the-badge)

dataprograms.org listed tools, products, and incentive programs designed to drive growth and make data storage on Filecoin more accessible. It was discontinued in April 2024.

## Estuary

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintenance-deprecated_07%2F2023-red.svg?style=for-the-badge)

Estuary was an experimental software platform designed for sending public data to the Filecoin network, facilitating data retrieval from anywhere. It integrated IPFS and Filecoin technologies to provide a seamless end-to-end example for data storage and retrieval. When a file was uploaded, Estuary immediately made multiple storage deals with different providers to ensure redundancy and security. The software automated many aspects of deal making and retrieval, offering tools for managing connections, block storage, and deal tracking. Estuary aimed to simplify the use of decentralized storage networks for developers and users.

Estuary was discontinued in July 2023, and the website shut down in April 2024.

### Big Data Exchange
