# PDP

{% hint style="danger" %}
**SOFT LAUNCH – LIMITED RELEASE**

This documentation covers the PDP (Proof of Data Possession) feature, which is now in soft launch and actively evolving. PDP is stable enough for early adopters and real-world integration testing, but changes may still occur as we finalise APIs and service behaviour.

For full production use and submitting live deals with PDP Storage Providers, please continue to use the [Synapse SDK](https://github.com/FilOzone/synapse-sdk).
