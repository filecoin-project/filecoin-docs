# Get test tokens

A faucet is available at [faucet.spacenet.ipc.space](https://faucet.spacenet.ipc.space) for developers to get test Filecoin (tFIL) on the Spacenet testnet. The faucet has the following restrictions:

* The per-request allowance given by the faucet is 10 tFIL.
* There is a daily maximum of 20 tFIL per address.
* And we have also limited the maximum amount of funds that can be withdrawn daily.
